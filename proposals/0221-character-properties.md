## Introduction

@allevato (a co-author here) proposed [Add Unicode Properties to Unicode.Scalar](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0211-unicode-scalar-properties.md), which exposes Unicode properties from the [Unicode Character Database](http://unicode.org/reports/tr44/). These are Unicode expert/enthusiast oriented properties that give a finer granularity of control and answer highly-technical and specific Unicody enquiries.

However, they are not ergonomic and Swift makes no attempt to clarify their interpretation or usage: meaning and proper interpretation is directly tied to the Unicode Standard and the version of Unicode available at run time. There‚Äôs some low-hanging ergo-fruit ripe for picking by exposing properties directly on `Character`.

Pitch thread: [Character and String properties](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-character-and-string-properties/11620)

## Motivation

`String` is a collection whose element is `Character`, which represents an [extended grapheme cluster](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries) (commonly just called ‚Äúgrapheme‚Äù).  This makes `Character` one of the first types encountered both by newcomers to Swift as well as by experienced Swift developers playing around in new domains (e.g. scripting). Yet `Character` exposes little functionality other than the ability to order it with respect to other characters, and a way to access the raw [Unicode scalar values](https://unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value) that comprise it.

This proposal adds several queries to increase the usefulness of `Character` and approachability of programming in Swift. It tries to walk the fuzzy line between what Swift can give reasonably good answers to, and what would require the user to adopt more elaborate linguistic analysis frameworks or techniques.

## Proposed Solution
(Note that Unicode does not define properties on graphemes in general. Swift is defining its own semantics in terms of Unicode semantics derived from scalar properties, semantics on strings, or both)

### Character Properties

```

Additionally, we propose an explicit `ascii:` label be added to `FixedWidthInteger`‚Äôs failable init from a `String`, and an additional one defined over `Character`. We argue the old name is harmful and an explicit label more closely adheres to the [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/). See ‚ÄúDetailed Semantics and Rationale‚Äù below.

```diff
- FixedWidthInteger.init?<S: StringProtocol>(_: S, radix: Int = 10)
+ FixedWidthInteger.init?<S: StringProtocol>(ascii: S, radix: Int = 10)
+ FixedWithInteger.init?(ascii: Character, radix: Int = 10)
```


## Detailed Semantics and Rationale

Some fuzziness is inherent in modeling human writing systems and the rules of grapheme breaking allow for semantically meaningless, yet technically valid, graphemes. In light of all this, we make a best effort and try to discover some principle to follow. Principles are useful for evaluating tradeoffs, but are not hard rules that always lead to a single clear answer.

The closest applicable principle might be something similar to W3C‚Äôs [Principle of Tolerance](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html), paraphrased as ‚ÄúBe liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you produce‚Äù. Character properties can be roughly grouped into those that ‚Äúproduce‚Äù specific values or behaviors, and those that ‚Äúaccept‚Äù graphemes under a fuzzy classification.

### Restrictive Properties

Properties that provide a clear interpretation or which the stdlib produces a specific value for should be restrictive. One example is `wholeNumberValue`. `wholeNumberValue` *produces* an `Int` from a `Character`, which means it needs to be *restrictive*, permitting only the graphemes with unambiguous whole number values. It only returns a value for single-scalar graphemes whose sole scalar has an integral numeric value. Thus, `wholeNumberValue` returns nil for ‚Äú7ÃÖ‚Äù (7 followed by U+0305 COMBINING OVERLINE) as there is no clear interpretation of the value. Any attempt to produce a specific integer from ‚Äú7ÃÖ‚Äù would be suspect.

Restrictive properties typically accept/reject based on an analysis of the entire grapheme.

* Values:  `isASCII` / `asciiValue`, `isWholeNumber` / `wholeNumberValue`, `isHexDigit` / `hexDigitValue`
* Casing:  `isUppercase` / `uppercased()`, `isLowercase` / `lowercased()`, `isCased`

### Permissive Properties

Where there is no clear interpretation or specific value to produce, we try to be as permissive as reasonable. For example, `isLetter` just queries the first scalar to see if it is ‚Äúletter-like‚Äù, and thus handles unforeseeable combinations of a base letter-like scalar with subsequent combining, modifying, or extending scalars. `isLetter` merely answers a general (fuzzy) question, but doesn‚Äôt prescribe further interpretation.

Permissive APIs should in general be non-inlinable and their documentation may be less precise regarding details and corner cases. This allows for a greater degree of library evolution. Permissive properties typically accept/reject based on an analysis of part of the grapheme.

* Fuzzy queries: `isNumber`, `isLetter`, `isSymbol` / `isMathSymbol` / `isCurrencySymbol`, `isPunctuation`, `isEmoji`

#### Newlines and Whitespace

Newlines encompass more than hard line-breaks in traditional written language; they are common terminators for programmer strings. Whether a `Character` such as `"\n\u{301}"` (a newline with a combining accent over it) is a newline is debatable. Either interpretation can lead to inconsistencies. If true, then a program might skip the first scalar in a new entry (whatever such a combining scalar at the start could mean). If false, then a `String` with newline terminators inside of it would return false for `myStr.contains { $0.isNewline }`, which is counter-intuitive. The same is true of whitespace.

We recommend that the precise semantics of `isWhitespace` and `isNewline` be unspecified regarding graphemes consisting of leading whitespace/newlines followed by combining scalars.

### Adding `ascii:` Label to `FixedWidthInteger.init?<S: StringProtocol>(_: S, radix: Int = 10)`

We argue that the `ascii:` label is required to clarify two primary ambiguities: the kinds of digits accepted and the encoding subset supported.

The existence of support for radices up to 36 implies that the kinds of digits accepted be restricted to Latin numerals and consecutively-encoded Latin letters (i.e. hexadecimal digits along with the next 20 letters). This is quite a mental leap to make without an explicit label. Additionally, this initializer rejects fullwidth compatibility forms which are otherwise considered digits with radices (i.e. they are hexadecimal digits with similar subsequent 20 letters).

We argue that the rules regarding omitting argument label for value-preserving type conversions do not apply as this initializer is not monomorphic due to casing.

This label‚Äôs clarity is more apparent in the proposed `FixedWithInteger.init?(ascii: Character, radix: Int = 10)`, and would preserve clarity with more-permissive initializers in the future.

## Source Compatibility
The properties on `Character` are strictly additive. The addition of the `ascii:` label to `FixedWithInteger.init(_:String,radix:Int)` will need to go through the normal unavailable/renamed deprecation process.

## Effect on ABI Stability
These changes are ABI-additive: they introduce new ABI surface area to keep stable.

The proposed solution includes recommended `@inlinable` annotations on properties which derive their value from other properties (thus benefitting from optimizations), or which are well-defined and stable under future Unicode versions (e.g. ASCII-related properties).

## Additions and Alternatives Considered

### Titlecase

Titlecase can be useful for some legacy scalars (ligatures) as well as for Strings when combined with word-breaking logic. However, it seems pretty obscure to surface on Character directly.

### String.Lines, String.Words

These have been deferred from this pitch to keep focus and await a more generalized lazy split collection.

### Rename Permissive `isFoo` to `hasFoo`

This was mentioned above in discussion of `isNewline` semantics and could also apply to `isWhitespace`. However, it would be awkward for `isNumber` or `isLetter`. What the behavior should be for exotic whitespace and newlines is heavily debatable. We‚Äôre sticking to `isNewline/isWhitespace` for now, but are open to argument.

### Design as `Character.has(OptionSet<‚Ä¶>, exclusively: ‚Ä¶)`

There could be something valuable to glean from this, but we reject this approach as somewhat un-Swifty with a poor discovery experience, especially for new or casual users. It does, however, make the semantic distinctions above very explicit at the call site.

### Add Failable FixedWidthInteger/FloatingPoint Initializers Taking Character

In addition to (or perhaps instead of) properties like `wholeNumberValue`, add `Character`-based `FixedWidthInteger.init?(_:Character)`. Similarly `FloatingPoint.init?(_:Character)` which includes vulgar fractions and the like (if single-scalar, perhaps). However, these do not have direct counterparts in this pitch as named, at least without an explicit argument label clarifying their semantics.

We could consider adding something like `FixedWidthInteger.init?(hexDigit: Character)` and `FixedWithInteger.init?(wholeNumber: Character)` which correspond to `hexDigitValue` and `wholeNumberValue`, and similarly a counterpart for `String`. But, we don‚Äôt feel this carries its weight as surfaced directly at the top level of e.g. `Int`. We prefer to keep this avenue open for future directions involving more general number parsing and grapheme evaluation logic.

### Keep `FixedWidthInteger.init(_:radix:)` around, or change `FixedWidthInteger.init(_:radix:)` to support full-width compatibility forms`

Rather than rename with an `ascii:` label, keep the old name around to be built upon later with a general number parsing system. We argue that the radix argument makes such an API highly dubious if not constrained to ASCII and full-width compatibility forms (e.g. akin to proposed `Character.hexDigitValue`).

Another alternative is to change the semantics to also accept full-width compatibility forms. Much of the argument for why the API should have an explicit label still apply, though the `radix` label does provide some prodding when provided. We‚Äôd prefer the explicit label if possible, but this could be a lessor of evils source-compatibility-preserving alternative.

### Drop `isASCII/HexDigit/WholeNumber`: Check for `nil` Instead

This alternative is to drop `isASCII`, `isHexDigit`, and `isWholeNumber` and instead use `if let` or compare explicitly to `nil`.

We decided to provide these convenience properties both for discoverability as well as use in more complex expressions: `c.isHexDigit && c.isLetter`, `c.isASCII && c.isWhitespace`, etc. We don‚Äôt think they add significant weight or undue API surface area.

### Add `numericValue: Double?` in addition to, or instead of, `wholeNumberValue: Int?`. Alternatively, add a `rationalValue: (numerator: Int, denominator: Int)?`.

Unicode defines numeric values for whole numbers, hex digits, and rational numbers (vulgar fractions). As an implementation artifact (ICU only vends a double), Unicode.Scalar.Properties‚Äôs `numericValue` is a double rather than an enum of a rational or whole number. We could follow suit and add such a value to `Character`, restricted to single-scalar graphemes. We could also remove `wholeNumberValue`, letting users test if the double is integral. Alternatively or additionally, we could provide a `rationalValue` capable of handling non-whole-numbers.

As far as adding a `rationalValue` is concerned, we do not feel that support for vulgar fractions and other obscure Unicode scalars (e.g. baseball score-keeping) warrants an addition to `Character` directly. `wholeNumberValue` producing an Int is a more fluid solution than a Double which happens to be integral, so we‚Äôre hesitant to replace `wholeNumberValue` entirely with a `numericValue`. Since `numericValue` would only add utility for these obscure characters, we‚Äôre not sure if it‚Äôs worth adding.

Suggestions for alternative names for `wholeNumberValue`would be appreciated.

### Replace `isEmoji` with 3 APIs, something something like `isEmojiPresentable`, `isEmojiWithDefaultTextPresentation`, and `isEmojiWithDefaultEmojiPresentation`

`isEmoji` encompasses both Characters with a default emoji presentation, as well as Characters with a default textual presentation and an explicit `U+FE0F` (emoji presentation selector). It rejects default emoji presentation Characters with an explicit `U+FE0E` (text presentation selector), as well as default textual presentation Characters which do not have an emoji presentation selector.

However, these only cover the default; whether something will actually be rendered as emoji depends on the render and environment. We‚Äôre open to further refining `isEmoji` with more API, but are unsure if they carry their weight. We currently feel this might be best left up to querying the rendering environment itself.  We‚Äôre interested in thoughts and/or use cases.

We are also considering relaxing `isEmoji` to return true for default-textual Characters without an explicit  text presentation selector. For example, `U+2708` (AIRPLANE) by default is rendered as `‚úà` and not `‚úàÔ∏è`. As proposed, `Character("\u{U+2708}").isEmoji` would return false, but we are considering having it return true because it *could* be rendered as emoji.
