# Swift Mach Port Interface

* Proposal: SE-0381
* Author(s): Daniel Loffgren <loffgren@apple.com>
* Status: **Review**
* Implementation: [apple/swift-system#116](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/pull/116)

## Introduction

Mach ports are an arcane technology that is difficult to wield safely.
However, as an integral component of our operating system, they occasionally require handling.

This proposal makes extenisve use of mach port terminology. Below are some resources that explain the basics.

- [Ports, Port Rights, Port Sets, and Port Namespaces ](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Mach/Mach.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH209-TPXREF104)

## Motivation

Mach ports are difficult to get right, due mostly to how mach port rights are managed. Programmers are expected to track types, lifecycles, and other state in their heads.

Swift's advanced type system, recently augmented with [move-only types](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0366-move-function.md), provides a new opportunity to create a Mach port interface able to prevent entire classes of bugs at compile time.

## Proposed solution

- Establish distinct types to represent recieve, send, and send-once rights.
- Provide automatic lifecycle management of Mach port rights, which are unlike normal OOP objects.

## Detailed design

`Mach.Port<T>` is the managed equivalent of a `mach_port_name_t`.
Mach port names can be moved in and out of instances as needed using `init` and `relinquish`.

```swift
func doStuffWithSendRightThenReturnIt(name:mach_port_name_t) -> mach_port_name_t {
	let send = Mach.Port<Mach.SendRight>(name)
	/* ... */
	return once.relinquish()
}
```

### Types

There are three types of Mach port right: receive, send, and send-once. In the C interface, the type of right being manipulatedÂ is not known by the compiler. In this Swift interface, the types explicitly declare which rights can be created from what other rights, and in what way, eliminating `KERN_INVALID_RIGHT` runtime failures.

### Allocation

Send and receive (but not send-once) port names are coalesced. In this interface, the caller is no longer involved in specifying the destination name when creating new rights. So, the `KERN_RIGHT_EXISTS` runtime error is not possible.

### Automatic Deallocation

All valid (in the Mach sense) port rights must be deallocated exactly once, including dead names. So, rights are deallocated when the object is deinited, unless a right is relinquished, in which case ownership is transferred out of the object and automatic deallocation at destruction is disabled. For receive ports this is a mod refs -1, but the intent is the same.

There is very little functional difference between `MACH_PORT_DEAD` and a valid dead name; `MACH_PORT_DEAD` simply means the port died before entering the task that received it. However, `MACH_PORT_DEAD` does not represent a right that requires deallocation. So, for convenience, constructing rights with `MACH_PORT_DEAD` is allowed, but automatic deallocation won't happen.

### Limits

The ipc space (the kernel-side storage of a proc's Mach port state) should be large enough to fit any reasonable workload. So, any time there is not enough ipc space to create a new right (`KERN_NO_SPACE`), the process will abort with a message indicating a possible bug. In the swift interface this is only possible when creating recieve or send-once rights.

Similar to ipc space, the uref field should be wide enough to fit any reasonable workload. So, in cases where a uref would overflow (`KERN_UREFS_OVERFLOW`), the process is aborted with a message indicating a possible bug.

### Swift Interface

```swift

        /// Mach.Port by name.

        /// This initializer aborts if name is MACH_PORT_NULL.
        ///
        /// If the type of the right does not match the type T of Mach.Port<T>
        /// being constructed, behavior is undefined.
        ///
        /// The underlying port right will be automatically deallocated at the
        /// end of the Mach.Port instance's lifetime.
        ///
        /// This initializer makes a syscall to guard the right.

        /// Borrow access to the port name in a block that can perform
        /// non-consuming operations.
        ///
        /// Take care when using this function; many operations consume rights,
        /// and send-once rights are easily consumed.

        /// If the right is consumed, behavior is undefined.

    enum PortRightError : Error {
        /// Returned when an operation cannot be completed, because the Mach
        /// port right has become a dead name. This is caused by deallocation of the
        /// receive right on the other end.

    }

## Alternatives considered

Having the port rights be `RawRepresentable<mach_port_name_t>`, which encourages passing instances to functions that will implicitly cast to `mach_port_name_t`. Since these APIs often consume the right, this requires manual management of the right's lifecycle.
