# Introduce Contiguous Collection Protocols

* Proposal: [SE-NNNN](NNNN-contiguous-collection.md)
* Authors: [Ben Cohen](https://github.com/airspeedswift)
* Review Manager: TBD
* Status: **Awaiting review**
* Implementation: [apple/swift#20484](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/20484)

## Introduction

This proposal introduces two new protocols, `ContiguousCollection`, and a
mutable version `MutableContiguousCollection`. These protocols will allow
generic code to make use of the `withUnsafe{Mutable}BufferPointer` idiom,
as well as provide fast paths in the standard library for adopting types.

Swift-evolution thread: [Contiguous Collection Protocols](https://forums.swift.org/t/contiguous-collection-protocols/17875)

## Motivation

Almost every feature of `Array` is made available via one of the protocols
in the standard library, and so most code written against `Array` can be
rewritten generically as an extension of one or more protocols.

The exceptions to this are the operations `withUnsafeBufferPointer` and
`withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer`, which are only available on the concrete
types. Given the usefulness of these methods, they should also be made
available generically.

## Proposed solution

Introduce two new protocols, with requirements representing the with-unsafe capabilities of `Array` & co:

```swift
/// A collection that supports access to its underlying contiguous storage.
public protocol ContiguousCollection: RandomAccessCollection
where SubSequence: ContiguousCollection {
  /// Calls a closure with a pointer to the array's contiguous storage.
  func withUnsafeBufferPointer<R>(
    _ body: (UnsafeBufferPointer<Element>) throws -> R
  ) rethrows -> R
}

/// A collection that supports mutable access to its underlying contiguous
/// storage.
public protocol MutableContiguousCollection: ContiguousCollection, MutableCollection
where SubSequence: MutableContiguousCollection {
  /// Calls the given closure with a pointer to the array's mutable contiguous
  /// storage.
  mutating func withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer<R>(
    _ body: (inout UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>) throws -> R
  ) rethrows -> R
}
```

Note, the mutable variant takes the buffer `inout`. This is to facilitate the ergnomics 
of calling `mutating` methods on it. Without this, users of the buffer would have to make a
temporary mutable copy (which would still update the passed-in buffer due to reference
semantics). Despite it being `inout`, any attempt to change the buffer to a different
pointer cannot generally work. It is up to collection implementors to either trap or ignore
this if the closure does it.

Conformances will be added for the following types:
- `Array`, `ArraySlice` and `ContiguousArray` will conform to `MutableContiguousCollection`
- `UnsafeBufferPointer` will conform to `ContiguousCollection`
- `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer` will conform to `MutableContiguousCollection`
- `Slice` will conditionally conform:
    - to `ContiguousCollection where Base: ContiguousCollection`
    - to `MutableContiguousCollection where Base: MutableContiguousCollection`

In addition, the following customization point should be added to
`MutableCollection`, with a default implementation when the collection is
mutably contiguously stored:

```swift
protocol MutableCollection {
  /// Call `body(p)`, where `p` is a pointer to the collection's
  /// mutable contiguous storage.  If no such storage exists, it is
  /// first created.  If the collection does not support an internal
  /// representation in a form of mutable contiguous storage, `body` is not
  /// called and `nil` is returned.
  public mutating func withUnsafeMutableBufferPointerIfSupported<R>(
    _ body: (inout UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>) throws -> R
  ) rethrows -> R?
}
```

This customization point already exists with an underscore in the standard
library (it just returns `nil` by default), and should be exposed to
general users, with a default implementation when the collection 
conforms to `MutableContiguousCollection`.

There are no guarantees made by the protocol about the state left behind if the
closure throws during mutation. The updates made may or may not be reflected in the 
collection (which might have given a direct pointer to its internal storage, or
could have handed out a temporary buffer that it then does not write back after
the error is thrown). The closure should always perform any cleanup it thinks is necessary
itself.

It should be documented that successive calls to `withUnsafe{Mutable}BufferPointer` are not
guaranteed to give you the same pointer with each call. For example, a packed small string
implementation may be giving you a pointer to that string temporarily expanded to a buffer.

Use of this entry point can provide significant speedups in some
algorithms, e.g. our current
[`sort`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/6662ccc16dba27418eefd3cb7856bddda5a33386/stdlib/public/core/Sort.swift#L249)
which needs to move elements of a collection back and forth between
some storage.

## Source compatibility

These are additive changes and do not affect source compatibility.

## Effect on ABI stability

These are additive changes and do not affect ABI stability.

## Alternatives considered

Some collections are not fully contiguous, but instead consist of multiple contiguous 
regions (for example, a ring buffer is one or two separate contiguous regions). A protocol that
exposed a collection of contiguous regions could be implemented on top of this protocol.

The `inout` argument to the closure in the mutating variant is debatable. It does imply the user
can change the buffer to a totally different one. Nonetheless, this is better handled in documentation,
since the improved ergnomics of the `inout` version are considerable. It would also be a source-breaking
change to alter `Array`'s implementation at this point.

The choice to refine `RandomAccessCollection` is based on the assumption that there are no reasonable
contiguous collections that wouldn't also be random-access.
