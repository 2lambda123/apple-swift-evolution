# Enhanced Floating Point Protocols

* Proposal: [SE-0067](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0067-floating-point-protocols.md)
* Author(s): [Stephen Canon](https://github.com/stephentyrone)
* Status: **Waiting for Scheduling**
* Review manager: TBD

## Introduction

The current FloatingPoint protocol is quite limited, and provides only a small
subset of the features expected of an IEEE 754 conforming type.  This proposal
expands the protocol to cover most of the expected basic operations, and adds
a second protocol, BinaryFloatingPoint, that provides a number of useful tools
for generic programming with the most commonly used types.

## Motivation

Beside the high-level motivation provided by the introduction, the proposed
prototypes address a number of pain points that we've heard about from
developers:

- FloatingPoint should conform to Equatable, and Comparable
- FloatingPoint should conform to FloatLiteralConvertible
- Deprecate the `%` operator for floating-point types
- Provide basic constants (analogues of C's DBL_MAX, etc.)
- Make Float80 conform to FloatingPoint

## Detailed design

The `FloatingPoint` protocol is split into two parts; `FloatingPoint` and
`BinaryFloatingPoint`, which conforms to `FloatingPoint`.  If decimal
types were added at some future point, they would conform to
`DecimalFloatingPoint`.

`FloatingPoint` is expanded to contain most of the IEEE 754 basic
operations, as well as conformance to `Comparable` (which implies `Equatable`),
and `IntegerLiteralConvertible` (`BinaryFloatingPoint` includes conformance
to `FloatLiteralConvertible`).

```swift
/// A floating-point type that provides most of the IEEE 754 basic (clause 5)
/// operations.  The base, precision, and exponent range are not fixed in
/// any way by this protocol, but it enforces the basic requirements of
/// any IEEE 754 floating-point type.
///
/// The BinaryFloatingPoint protocol refines these requirements, adds some
/// additional operations that only make sense for a fixed radix, and also
/// provides default implementations of some of the FloatingPoint APIs.
public protocol FloatingPoint: Comparable, IntegerLiteralConvertible {

  /// An unsigned integer type that can represent the significand of any value.
  ///
  /// The significand (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significand) is frequently
  /// also called the "mantissa", but this terminology is slightly incorrect
  /// (see the "Use of 'mantissa'" section on the linked Wikipedia page for
  /// more details).  "Significand" is the preferred terminology in IEEE 754.
  associatedtype RawSignificand: UnsignedInteger

  /// Initialize to zero
  init()

  /// Initialize from signBit, exponent, and significand.
  ///
  /// The result is:
  ///
  /// ~~~
  /// (signBit ? -1 : 1) * significand * radix**exponent
  /// ~~~
  ///
  /// (where `**` is exponentiation) computed as if by a single correctly-
  /// rounded floating-point operation.  If this value is outside the
  /// representable range of the type, overflow or underflow occurs, and zero,
  /// a subnormal value, or infinity may result, as with any basic operation.
  /// Other edge cases:
  ///
  /// - If `significand` is zero or infinite, the result is zero or infinite,
  ///   regardless of the value of `exponent`.
  ///
  /// - If `significand` is NaN, the result is NaN.
  ///
  /// Note that for any floating-point `x` the result of
  ///
  ///   `Self(signBit: x.signBit,
  ///         exponent: x.exponent,
  ///         significand: x.significand)`
  ///
  /// is "the same" as `x`; it is `x` canonicalized.

  /// This initializer implements the IEEE 754 `scaleB` operation.

  //
  // - Some languages have used "epsilon" to refer to wildly different values,
  //   such as `leastMagnitude`.
  //
  // - Inexperienced users often believe that "epsilon" should be used as a
  //   tolerance for floating-point comparisons, because of the name.  It is
  //   nearly always the wrong value to use for this purpose.

The `BinaryFloatingPoint` protocol provides a number of additional APIs
that only make sense for types with fixed radix 2:

```swift
/// A radix-2 (binary) floating-point type that follows the IEEE 754 encoding
/// conventions.
public protocol BinaryFloatingPoint: FloatingPoint, FloatLiteralConvertible {

  /// Combines `signBit`, `exponent` and `significand` bit patterns to produce
  /// a floating-point value.
  init(signBit: Bool,
       exponentBitPattern: UInt,
       significandBitPattern: RawSignificand)

  //  NOTE: --------------------------------------------------------------------
  //  The next two APIs are not implementable without a revised integer
  //  protocol.  Nonetheless, I believe that it makes sense to consider them
  //  with the rest of this proposal, with the understanding that they will
  //  be implemented when it becomes possible to do so.

  /// `value` rounded to the closest representable value.
  init<Source: BinaryFloatingPoint>(_ value: Source)

  /// Fails if `value` cannot be represented exactly as `Self`.
  init?<Source: BinaryFloatingPoint>(exactly value: Source)
  //  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  /// The number of bits used to represent the exponent.
  ///
  /// Following IEEE 754 encoding convention, the exponent bias is:
  ///
  /// ~~~
  /// bias = 2**(exponentBitCount-1) - 1
  /// ~~~
  ///
  /// (where `**` is exponentiation).  The least normal exponent is `1-bias`
  /// and the largest finite exponent is `bias`.  The all-zeros exponent is
  /// reserved for subnormals and zeros, and the all-ones exponent is reserved
  /// for infinities and NaNs.
  static var exponentBitCount: Int { get }

  /// For fixed-width floating-point types, this is the number of fractional
  /// significand bits.
  ///
  /// For extensible floating-point types, `significandBitCount` should be
  /// the maximum allowed significand width (without counting any leading

  /// `significandBitCount` should be `Int.max`.
  ///
  /// Note that `Float80.significandBitCount` is 63, even though 64 bits
  /// are used to store the significand in the memory representation of a
  /// `Float80` (unlike other floating-point types, `Float80` explicitly
  /// stores the leading integral significand bit, but the

  ///   and `x.significandWidth` is 23.
  var significandWidth: Int { get }

  //  NOTE: --------------------------------------------------------------------
  //  These APIs are not implementable without the generic inits, which in turn
  //  depend on a revised Integer protocol.  Nonetheless, I believe that it

`Float`, `Double`, `Float80` and `CGFloat` conform to both of these protocols.

Additionally, an initializer will be added to each of those types to construct
a NaN with specified payload:

```swift
  /// NaN with specified `payload`.
  ///
  /// Compares not equal to every value, including itself.  Most operations
  /// with a NaN operand will produce a NaN result.
  init(nan payload: Self.RawSignificand, signaling: Bool)

## Impact on existing code

1. The `%` operator is no longer available for FloatingPoint types.  We don't
believe that it was widely used correctly, and the operation is still available
via the `formTruncatingRemainder` method for people who need it.

2. To follow the naming guidelines, `NaN` and `isNaN` are replaced with `nan`
and `isNan`.

3. The redundant property `quietNaN` is removed.

4. `isSignaling` is renamed `isSignalingNan`.

## Changes from the draft proposal

1. Removed the `Arithmetic` protocol; it may be circulated again in the future
as an independent proposal, or as part of an new model for integers.

2. Removed the `add[ing]`, `subtract[ing]`, etc methods, which were hooks for
`Arithmetic`.  This proposal now includes only the existing operator forms.

3. Removed static `nan(payload: signaling:)` method from protocols.  This will
exist as an initializer on concrete types, but not be part of the protocol.

4. Added the static `signalingNaN` property to the protocol to make up for #3.

5. Added the static `pi` property in response to popular demand.

6. Renamed the static `ulp` property `ulpOfOne` to avoid ambiguity with the
member property `ulp`.

7. Renamed `totalOrder` to `isTotallyOrdered` to be consistent with the other
comparison methods.

8. Additional clarifications and comments.
