## Introduction

The noncopyable types introduced in [SE-0390: Noncopyable structs and enums](0390-noncopyable-structs-and-enums.md) come with the heavy limitation that such values cannot be substituted for a generic type parameter, erased to an existential, or conform to a protocol.
This proposal extends Swift's type system with syntax and semantics allowing noncopyable types to be used in all of these ways.

## Motivation

SE-0390 laid the groundwork for declaring struct and enum types that cannot be copied.
This ensures correct semantics for types for which it is not meaningful to
have multiple copies:
```swift
// A file descriptor cannot be usefully used from
// multiple places at once, so make it non-copyable
// to prevent such usage.
struct FileDescriptor: ~Copyable { ... }
```

This also provides an alternative to class objects for some use cases.
In particular, the tightly defined lifecycle allows noncopyable structs
to carry deinitializers:
```swift
struct HeapBuffer: ~Copyable {
  init() { ... allocate working storage on heap ... }
  deinit() { ... release storage ... }
}
```

But SE-0390 also made a number of concessions to simplify the initial implementation,
limitations which significantly reduce the usefulness of noncopyable types.

For example, SE-0390 did not allow noncopyable types to be used in generics,
which prevents them from being used with `Optional`,
which then prevents you from defining a failable initializer on a noncopyable type:
```swift
struct FileDescriptor: ~Copyable {
  init?(filename: String) { // üõë Cannot return Optional<FileDescriptor>
    ...
  }
}
```

Practical use of generics also requires supporting protocol conformances,
since generic parameters gain capabilities when they are constrained to particular protocols:
```swift
// T is capable of being compared with other T's
func max<T: Comparable>(...) { ... }
```

In order to broaden the expressiveness and utility of noncopyable types, then,
language extensions are needed to allow these types to be used in generic parameters,
to conform to protocols, and to be stored in existentials.
This in turn requires a consistent and sound way to relax the fundamental
assumption of copyability that permeates Swift's generics system.

## Proposed Solution

There are three fundamental components to this proposal that together provide a solution for noncopyable generics:

1. The `Copyable` protocol indicates that values of a particular type can be copied
2. This protocol is applied by default to type definitions and generic requirements
3. The `~Copyable` notation can suppress this implicit requirement in specific cases

**Note**: This proposal does not cover adapting the standard library to support noncopyable types.

### The `Copyable` Protocol

`Copyable` is a new protocol that represents types that support copying.
Values in Swift that support copying will now conform to `Copyable`.
Naturally, the set of noncopyable types are exactly those that do _not_ conform to `Copyable`.

When initializing a new variable binding using an existing struct or enum value, semantically the binding is initialized with a copy as long as the value is `Copyable`.
Otherwise, the value is moved into the binding.
See [SE-0390](0390-noncopyable-structs-and-enums.md) for more details about copy/move behaviors and working with noncopyable types.

**Note**: For clarity, the examples in this proposal will detail implicit requirements in comments.
In this example
```swift
func f<T>(_ t: T) /* where T: Copyable */ {}
```
the comment indicates that the requirement `T: Copyable` is an implicit default that will be automatically inferred by the generics system.

In addition, comments with _generic signature_ or _interface type_ may appear next to a type or function, respectively.
These generic signatures will detail all of the requirements or type constraints for generic parameters in scope:
```swift
// signature <Self where Self: Comparable & Copyable>
protocol P: Comparable {}

struct S<T: Equatable> {
  func f() {}  // signature <T where T: Equatable & Copyable>
}
```

#### Conforming to `Copyable`

`Copyable` has no explicit requirements.
`Copyable` conformance is generally implicit and inferred by the compiler unless it is explicitly suppressed.

In particular:
* Value types like structs and enums conform to `Copyable` when they do not contain a `deinit` and all of their stored properties or associated values conform to `Copyable`.
* Reference types like classes and actors can always conform to `Copyable`, because a reference to an object can always be copied, regardless of what is contained in the object.
* Metatypes are always copyable as they represent immutable information about a type.
* Support for noncopyable tuples and element packs are left to future work.

### Type parameters

All generic type parameters default to carrying a `Copyable` conformance constraint:

```swift
struct FileDescriptor: ~Copyable { /* ... */ }

func genericFn<T>(_ t: T) /* where T: Copyable */ {
  return copy t  // OK
}

genericFn(FileDescriptor())  // ERROR: FileDescriptor is not Copyable
genericFn([1, 2]) // OK: Array<Int> is Copyable
```

In [SE-0390](0390-noncopyable-structs-and-enums.md) the prefix `~` syntax was introduced only in the inheritance clause of a nominal type to "suppress" its default `Copyable` conformance.
This proposal completes the picture by defining the semantics of `~Copyable` as _suppressing the default requirements_ for `Copyable` conformance.
Suppressing requirements other than `Copyable` is outside the scope of this proposal.

A generic parameter can have its default `Copyable` requirement suppressed by applying `~Copyable` to the parameter:

```swift
func identity<T: ~Copyable>(_ t: borrowing T) -> T  {
  return copy t  // ERROR: 't' may not be copyable
}

identity(FileDescriptor())  // OK, FileDescriptor is not Copyable
identity([1, 2, 3])  // OK, even though Array<Int> is Copyable
```

> **Key Idea:** Suppressing the `Copyable` requirement by using `T: ~Copyable` does _not_ prevent a `Copyable` type from being substituted for `T`.
> This is the reason why the syntax `~Copyable` is referred to as _suppressing_ `Copyable` rather than _inverting_ or _negating_ it.

As with a concrete noncopyable type, any generic type parameter that does not conform to `Copyable` must use one of the ownership modifiers `borrowing`, `consuming`, or `inout`, when it appears as the type of a function's parameter.
For details on these parameter ownership modifiers, see [SE-377](0377-parameter-ownership-modifiers.md).

### Structs and enums

All struct and enum types conform to `Copyable` by default:

```swift
struct DataSet /* : Copyable */ {
  var samples: [Double]
}
```

Similarly, generic type arguments are constrained to be `Copyable` by default.
For example, the generic argument `Element` in this `List`:

```swift
enum List<Element /* : Copyable */> /* : Copyable */ {
  case empty
  indirect case node(Element, List<Element>)
}
```

As in SE-390, a generic struct or enum can use `~Copyable` to suppress the implicit `Copyable` conformance and constraint:

```swift
enum List<Elm: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable { /* ... */ }

// or equivalently:

enum List<Elm>: ~Copyable where Elm: ~Copyable { /* ... */ }
```

Since `Elm` is not required to be `Copyable`, a noncopyable type like `FileDescriptor` can be substituted in `List`, in addition to copyable ones.

### Classes

Classes (including actors) are always `Copyable`,
even if they have noncopyable properties.
This proposal does not provide support for noncopyable classes.
```swift
class FileHandle<File> /* : Copyable where File: Copyable */ {
  var file: File
  // ...
}
```

Generic parameters on classes are `Copyable` by default.
This can be suppressed with `~Copyable` on the type parameter:
```swift
class FileHandle<File: ~Copyable> /* : Copyable */ {
  var file: File
  // ...
}
```

### Protocols

Protocols and their associated types default to implicit `Copyable` conformance requirement:

```swift
// signature <Self where Self: Copyable, Self.T: Copyable>
protocol Foo /* : Copyable */ {
  associatedtype T /* : Copyable */

  borrowing func bar() -> Self
  func buzz(_: T) -> T
  func blarg() -> RequiresCopyable<Self>
}
```

Protocols can suppress the default `Copyable` requirement from `Self` using `~Copyable`:

```swift
// signature <Self where Self.Event: Copyable>
protocol EventLog: ~Copyable {
  associatedtype Event /* : Copyable */

  mutating func push(_ event: Event)
  mutating func pop() throws -> Event
}
```

Within `EventLog`, the type `Self` has no conformance requirements at all, but the associated type `Self.Event` is copyable.
Suppressing the `Copyable` conformance requirement on `EventLog` allows copyable and noncopyable types to conform:

```swift
// signature <Self where Self: EventLog, Self: Copyable>
struct ArrayLog<Element>: EventLog /*, Copyable where Element: Copyable */ {
  typealias Event = Element
  var log: [Element]
  // ...
}

// signature <Self where Self: EventLog>
struct UniqueLog<Element>: EventLog, ~Copyable /* where Element: Copyable */ {
  typealias Event = Element
  var log: [Element]
  // ...
}
```

Associated types can additionally use `~Copyable` to suppress their default `Copyable` requirement, allowing a noncopyable type to witness the requirement:

```swift
protocol JobQueue<Job> /* : Copyable */ {
  associatedtype Job: ~Copyable

  func submit(_ job: consuming Job)
}
```

#### Protocol Extensions

An extension of a protocol is implicitly constrained to `Self: Copyable` unless you explicitly state otherwise.
```swift
protocol EventLog: ~Copyable {
  ...
}

extension EventLog /* where Self: Copyable */ {
  func duplicate() -> Self {
    return copy self // OK
  }
}
```

If you wish to extend the behavior for noncopyable `Self`, you must explicitly state so:
```swift
extension EventLog where Self: ~Copyable {
  ...
}
```

#### Protocol Inheritance

A type must restate `~Copyable` even if it only conforms to protocols that are `~Copyable`, because the _absence_ of a requirement is not propagated:

```swift
protocol Token: ~Copyable {}

// signature <Self where Self : Token, Self : Copyable>
protocol ArcadeCoin: Token /* , Copyable */ {}

// signature <Self where Self : Token>
protocol CasinoChip: Token, ~Copyable {}
```

Note that `~Copyable` on a protocol is not viral:
types that conform to a `~Copyable` protocol can themselves be `Copyable`.
Similarly, a protocol that inherits from a noncopyable one can still require its
conformers to be `Copyable`.

In contrast, associated type requirements that are inherited from another protocol do preserve `~Copyable`.
In the following example, `JobQueue.Job` remains noncopyable in `FIFOJobQueue`:
```swift
// signature <Self: Copyable>
protocol JobQueue /* : Copyable */ {
  associatedtype Job: ~Copyable
  // ...
}

// signature <Self where Self: Copyable, Self: JobQueue>
protocol FIFOJobQueue<Job>: JobQueue {
  // associatedtype Job: ~Copyable // Because inherited
  func pushBack(_ j: Job) // error: missing ownership specifier for parameter of
                          //        noncopyable type 'Job'
}
```

However, if the associated type requirement is  redeclared in the inheritor,
the usual rule for `associatedtype` requirements will add an implicit `Copyable` requirement for the redeclaration:

```swift
// signature <Self where Self: JobQueue, Self.Job: Copyable>
protocol LIFOJobQueue<Event>: JobQueue {
  associatedtype Job /* : Copyable */
}
```

## Detailed Design

This section spells out additional details about the proposed extensions.

### Conditionally-copyable types

A generic type with properties that may or may not be copyable will often want
to conditionally declare copyability.

Since `Copyable` is an additive capability, this must be done by declaring
the base type to not require copyability and then conditionally extending it:
```swift
struct MaybeCopyable<T: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable {
  var t: T
}

extension MaybeCopyable /* : Copyable where T: Copyable */ { }
```

Conditional conformances to `Copyable` can only depend on
generic parameters being `Copyable`.
For example:
```swift
protocol P { }
struct Foo<T: ~Copyable> { }

extension Foo: P where T == Int { } // OK
extension Foo: P where T: Copyable { } // OK
extension Foo: Copyable where T: Copyable { } // OK
extension Foo: Copyable where T: P { } // üõë
extension Foo: Copyable where T == Int {} // üõë
extension Foo: Copyable where T: Sendable {} // üõë
extension Foo: Copyable where T.A: Copyable {} // üõë
```

### The top type

The type `Any` is no longer the "top" type in the language, which is the type that is a supertype of all types.
The new world order is:

```
              any ~Copyable
               /         \
              /           \
   Any == any Copyable   <all noncopyable types>
        |
< all other copyable types >
```

### Existentials

Like type parameters, existentials have an implicit default `Copyable` constraint.
An existential consisting of a composition that includes `~Copyable` will remove this `Copyable` default:

```swift
protocol Pizza: ~Copyable {
  associatedtype Topping: ~Copyable
  func peelOneTopping() -> Topping
}

let t: any Pizza = ... // signature <Self where Self: Copyable, Self: Pizza, Self.Topping: Copyable>
let _: any Copyable = t.peelOneTopping() // signature <Self: Copyable>

let u: any Pizza & ~Copyable = ... // signature <Self: Pizza>
let _: any ~Copyable = u.peelOneTopping() // signature <Self>
```
Associated types within a protocol erased to an existential preserve conformances to `Copyable`.
So when calling `peelOneTopping` on an `any Pizza`, an `any ~Copyable` value is returned instead of `any Copyable`.

### Diagnosing contradictory intent

An error will be diagnosed whenever a type includes an explicit `~Copyable` but its generic requirements can only be satisfied if it were `Copyable`.
This can occur in cases such as the following:
```swift
protocol CopyableProtocol /* : Copyable */ { ... }

// Error: `S` is `Copyable` but has an explicit `~Copyable`
struct S: CopyableProtocol, ~Copyable { ... }
```

This diagnostic only occurs if the `~Copyable` is directly specified:
```swift
protocol CopyableProtocol /* : Copyable */ { ... }
protocol MaybeCopyableProtocol: ~Copyable { ... }
struct S: CopyableProtocol, MaybeCopyableProtocol { ... } // OK
```

### Scoping rule

A constraint suppression like `~Copyable` can only be applied to a type parameter within the same scope as the constraint:

```swift
struct S<T> { // signature: <T: Copyable>
  func f() where T: ~Copyable // signature: <T>
  // error: cannot suppress constraint 'T: ~Copyable' on generic parameter 'T' defined in outer scope
}
```

Rationale: An outer generic context, like `S<T>`, already requires that `T` is `Copyable`.
Removing that `Copyable` requirement for the nested generic context `S<T>.f` is useless, as there will never be a noncopyable value substituted for `S<T>`.
The same logic applies to mututally-scoped contexts:

```swift
protocol P {
  // error: cannot suppress constraint 'Self.Alice: ~Copyable' on generic parameter 'Self.Alice' defined in outer scope
  associatedtype Bob where Alice: ~Copyable
  associatedtype Alice where Bob: ~Copyable
  // error: cannot suppress constraint 'Self.Bob: ~Copyable' on generic parameter 'Self.Bob' defined in outer scope
}
```

## Source Compatibility

Since `Copyable` is implicitly assumed for any context that does not explicitly
specify `~Copyable`, this does not change the interpretation of existing code.

## ABI compatibility

Ordinarily, mangled symbols include a list of protocols to which the entity conforms.
To preserve the ABI for existing code (which now implicitly conforms to `Copyable`),
we are adjusting the mangling policy to encode the lack of a `Copyable` requirement
rather than its presence.
This ensures that existing ABI will end up with the same symbols as before.

## Implications on adoption

**ABI**: Adding `~Copyable` to an existing type, function, or generic parameter is generally an ABI-breaking change.

Targeted mechanisms are being explored that can be used to preserve ABI compatibility when adding `~Copyable` to existing types,
but such mechanisms will require extreme care to use correctly.
In particular, this can allow clients to compile against new versions of a library and then run with an old version.
Of course, if the old version attempts to copy a non-copyable value, this will break.

**Source**: Adding `~Copyable` to a generic parameter on a function
is generally not source-breaking for existing clients that provide
implicitly-`Copyable` types for such parameters.

Adding `~Copyable` to an existing type or protocol (generic or concrete) is typically
source-breaking, as existing code may rely on the ability to copy values of this type.

Adding `~Copyable` to an associated type is also generally source breaking.

## Alternatives Considered

### `NonCopyable` as a Positive Requirement

Our proposal above adds `Copyable` to the Swift language as a default property of all types
and a default requirement in all generic contexts.
It then uses `~Copyable` to indicate that this default property and/or requirement should be suppressed.

An alternative approach would instead add `NonCopyable` as a positive requirement.
In essence, `NonCopyable` would be the positive assertion that values of this type will
receive additional scrutiny inside the compiler:
```swift
struct AltS<T: NonCopyable> { ... }
struct AltNC: NonCopyable { ... }
var s3: AltS<AltNC> // OK. AltNC is not copyable
var s4: AltS<Int> // üõë Int is not NonCopyable
```

This would make any type `T & NonCopyable` be a subtype of `T`.
In particular, `NonCopyable` itself would be a subtype of `Any`,
which implies that such values can be assigned into an `Any` existential.
But `Any` can be arbitrarily copied, so we cannot allow this.
This applies equally to any other container.

### `‚ùåCopyable` as a Negative Requirement

Another alternative would introduce a syntax `‚ùåCopyable`
that serves as a negative requirement.
Such a marker in any context would indicate that the `Copyable`
capability _must not_ be present.
This is distinctly different than our proposed `~Copyable` which
indicates that `Copyable` is not required in this context.
```swift
func f<T: ‚ùåCopyable>(_ t: T) { ... }

f(7) // üõë Int is copyable
```

This approach would fundamentally undermine the current behavior
of Swift generics, which assumes that all constraints on a generic
type variable are _minimum_ requirements.
As explained above, `Copyable` types are able to be copied which
implies they have strictly _more_ capabilities than the equivalent
type without copyability.

### Alternative Spellings

Spellings other than `~Copyable` are possible.
As argued immediately above, a suitable spelling must indicate
the relaxation of a default copyable requirement.
This is most natural if the copyable requirement is spelled `Copyable`
and a sigil indicates the suppression of that requirement.
Both `?` and `!` are reasonable alternative sigils,
but `~` better conveys the intent while avoiding confusion with the
existing uses of `?` and `!` in the language.

### Inferred Conditional Copyability

It would be possible to infer conditional copyability for generic types with
stored properties that might not be copyable.
```swift
struct MaybeCopyable<T: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable {
  var t: T
}

// This could be inferred
extension MaybeCopyable: Copyable where T: Copyable { }
```
But initial attempts to adopt this feature have suggested that
such inference is more confusing than helpful.

### Extension defaults

This proposal specifies that extensions and redefinitions
default to `Copyable` rather than implicitly inheriting
the copyability of the base.

It would be possible to allow library authors to explicitly control this behavior.
New syntax could allow library authors to choose the
appropriate behavior for their types:
* Old types can gain support for noncopyable types
  without breaking existing extensions in client code
* New types specifically targeting noncopyable uses
  could have a more natural interface.

This could be provided by a `default extension` feature
as outlined here:
```swift
public enum Either<T: ~Copyable, U: ~Copyable> {
  case a(T)
  case b(U)
  case empty

  // Neither `T` nor `U` is copyable for members here.

  default extension where T: Copyable
  default extension where U: ~Copyable
}

// `T` is copyable and `U` noncopyable because of the defaults above
extension Perhaps /* where T: Copyable, U: ~Copyable */ { ... }

// Specific extensions can override the defaults
extension Perhaps where T: ~Copyable, U: Copyable { ... }

```

This becomes much more complex for protocols with associated types:
```swift
protocol P: ~Copyable {
  associatedtype A: P, ~Copyable

  default extension where A: Copyable
}

extension P {
  // A is Copyable here
  // What about A.A?  A.A.A?
  // Do we need syntax for the infinite
  // set of {A, A.A, A.A.A, ...}?
}
```

In addition to the complexity suggested by the above,
early experiments suggested that this approach actually leads to
considerable confusion about the meaning of a particular
extension.
As a result, this idea was ultimately omitted from this proposal.

## Future Directions

### Standard Library and Concurrency support

The core `Optional` and `UnsafePointer` family of types will be updated
soon to support noncopyable elements.
A proposal will be forthcoming.

The rest of the Swift standard library, including
the standard collections (`Array`, `Dictionary`, `Set`, etc.),
core collection protocols (`Iterator`, `Sequence`, `RangeReplaceableCollection`, etc.),
and the core concurrency types (`Task`, `AsyncSequence`, etc.)
will be updated incrementally over time.
Future proposals will explore this area.

### Tuples and element packs

Tuples and variadic element packs can only be copied
if all of their elements are copyable.
A forthcoming proposal will provide details.

### `~Escapable`

The ability to "escape" the current context is another implicit capability
of all current Swift types.
Suppressing this requirement provides an alternative way to control object lifetimes.
A companion proposal will provide details.

### Non-copyable Classes

This proposal supports classes with generic parameters,
but it does not permit classes to be directly marked `~Copyable`.
Similarly, `AnyObject` cannot be combined with `~Copyable`:
```swift
func f<T>(_ t: T) where T: AnyObject, T: ~Copyable { ... }
```

If supported, such classes could avoid essentially all reference-counting operations,
which could be a significant performance boost in practice.
This will be explored in a future proposal.

### Dynamic Queries and Runtime Support

The current implementation does not provide a mechanism to test at runtime whether
a value is copyable.
```swift
// Possible future extensions...
if MemoryLayout<T>.isCopyable { ... }
if let t = value as? Copyable { ... }
```

This proposal does not support dynamic casts to or from noncopyable existentials.
In particular, this requires `Optional` to fully supporting noncopyable types.
```swift
// Future support
if let y = x as? P & ~Copyable {
  // The value in y:
  // * conforms to P
  // * might not be copyable
  // So y itself cannot be copied.
  if let z = y as? Int {
    ...
  }
}
```

This issue will be addressed in a future proposal.
