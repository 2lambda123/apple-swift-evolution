# Either

* Proposal: [SE-0015](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0015-either.md)
* Author(s): [TypeLift](https://github.com/TypeLift)
* Status: **Review**
* Review manager: TBD

## Introduction

This proposal details the addition of a left-biased sum type to the
Swift Standard Library.  Earlier attempts at adding this have been too
specifically focused on error handling (duplicating functionality
`throws` already provides), whereas this implementation will focus on
data, organization, and type safety.  We believe that adding the type
to the standard library and simultaneously emphasizing its use cases 
-that is, when you need a type that represents exactly 2 disjoint possibilities-
can dispel the confusion caused in other languages
and quell the conflict with `throws`.

## Motivation

Inevitably, it seems languages reach the point where they see the need
to handle finite-argument disjoint variants with a data type as was
done in C++, C#, D, F#, SML, Haskell, Scala, ALGOL, and many others.
When coupled with a strong, static type system they can be made even
more useful because support for totality checking and safety come from
the language itself.  Recently, certain prominent implementations have
chosen to use an `Either` type to represent control flows that can
possibly raise errors.  But Either can be written without this
convention to simply be a generic type, which is what we propose.

As before, unlike `throws`, a disjoint union type can be applied in arbitrary
positions, used as a member, and easily checked for completeness
at compile time.  In addition, the lack of a standard union type has
led the Swift community to create [numerous](https://github.com/search?utf8=âœ“&q=Either+language%3Aswift) duplicate implementations of the 
same mutually incompatible types over and over and over again.  In the 
interest of promoting a type that there has received clear interest by the 
community, the addition to the Standard Library is necessary.

## Proposed solution

The Swift Standard Library will be updated to include a left-biased
sum type we have called `Either` - though other names may be
appropriate depending on how the type is implemented.

## Detailed design

A complete implementation, based on the [Swiftx](https://github.com/typelift/Swiftx/blob/master/Swiftx/Either.swift) library's implementation, with comments is given below:

```swift
/// The `Either` type represents values with two possibilities:
/// `.Left(LeftValue)` or `.Right(RightValue)`.
///
/// The `Either` type is left-biased by convention.  That is, the values in the
/// `Left` half of the `Either` are considered fair game to be transformed using
/// e.g. `map` and `flatMap` while values in the `Right` half of the `Either`
/// are considered constant.
public enum Either<LeftValue, RightValue> {
	case Left(LeftValue)
	case Right(RightValue)

	/// Much like the ?? operator for `Optional` types, takes a value and a
	/// function, and if the receiver is `.Right`, returns the value, otherwise
	/// maps the function over the value in `.Left` and returns that value.
	public func fold<U>(value : U, @noescape f : (LeftValue) throws -> U) rethrows -> U {
		return try self.either(onLeft: f, onRight: { _ in value });
	}

	/// Applies the given function to any left values contained in the receiver,
	/// leaving any right values untouched.
	public func map<U>(@noescape f: (LeftValue) throws -> U) rethrows -> Either<U, RightValue> {
		switch self {
		case let .Left(l):
			return .Left(try f(l))
		case let .Right(r):
			return .Right(r)
		}
	}

	/// If the `Either` is `Right`, simply returns a new `Right` with
	/// the value of the receiver. If `Left`, applies the function `f`
	/// and returns the result.
	public func flatMap<U>(@noescape f: (LeftValue) throws -> Either<U, RightValue>) rethrows -> Either<U, RightValue> {
		switch self {
		case let .Left(l):
			return try f(l)
		case let .Right(r):
			return .Right(r)
		}
	}

	/// Case analysis for the `Either` type.
	///
	/// If the value is `.Left(a)`, apply the first function to `a`. If it is
	/// `.Right(b)`, apply the second function to `b`.
	public func either<U>(@noescape onLeft onLeft : (LeftValue) throws -> U, @noescape onRight : (RightValue) throws -> U) rethrows -> U {
		switch self {
		case let .Left(e):
			return try onLeft(e)
		case let .Right(e):
			return try onRight(e)
		}
	}

	/// Reverses the order of values of the receiver.
	public var flip : Either<RightValue, LeftValue> {
		switch self {
		case let .Left(l):
			return .Right(l)
		case let .Right(r):
			return .Left(r)
		}
	}

	/// Determines if this `Either` value is a `Left`.
	public var isLeft : Bool {
		switch self {
		case .Left(_):
			return true
		case .Right(_):
			return false
		}
	}

	/// Determines if this `Either` value is a `Right`.
	public var isRight : Bool {
		switch self {
		case .Right(_):
			return true
		case .Left(_):
			return false
		}
	}
}

extension Either : CustomStringConvertible {
	/// A textual representation of `self`.
	public var description : String {
		switch self {
		case let .Left(l):
			return "Left(\(l))"
		case let .Right(r):
			return "Right(\(r))"
		}
	}
}

public func == <LeftValue : Equatable, RightValue : Equatable>(lhs : Either<LeftValue, RightValue>, rhs : Either<LeftValue, RightValue>) -> Bool {
	switch (lhs, rhs) {
	case let (.Left(l), .Left(r)) where l == r:
		return true
	case let (.Right(l), .Right(r)) where l == r:
		return true
	default:
		return false
	}
}

public func != <LeftValue : Equatable, RightValue : Equatable>(lhs : Either<LeftValue, RightValue>, rhs : Either<LeftValue, RightValue>) -> Bool {
	return !(lhs == rhs)
}
```

## Impact on existing code

As this is an addition to the Standard Library, no existing code should be affected
unless the author happens to be using the identifier Either - in which case
there is a strong chance that their Either and our Either are the same
thing, aligning with the goal of removing duplicate implementations of
this common type.

The fears of the previous proposal that attempted to put a `Result<T>`
type in the Standard Library, of duplicating existing functionality with respect to
`throws` remain, but as noted before `throws` is not as
flexible or declarative enough for all possible cases.  If necessary,
a note can be left in the documentation warning away users of the
`Either` type that really need `throws`.

## Alternatives considered

The bias in this definition of Either may be a sticking point, but the
presence of an unbiased Either would lead to confusion as to what both
lobes of the type were for.  [As noted in the mailing list](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151207/001423.html), such a type would
be equivalent to `(A?, B?)` with convenience methods to extract values
and induct on the "cases" of each side of the tuple.

In addition, the name `Either` does not lend much to the imagination,
and the use of `Left` and `Right` cause considerable confusion to
novices in Haskell precisely because the type is used mostly for error
handling.  If that case were discouraged, and this type treated like
data first, the use of `Left` and `Right` and `Either` becomes less nebulous.  Mostly, the
name does not matter so much as the structure, so possibilities for a
renaming including cases are:

- Result: Error, Value
- Sum: Left, Right
- Alternative: First, Second
- These: This, That
- OneOf: First, Second/This, That
- Variant: First, Second
- Or: Left, Right
- XOr: Left, Right
- Branch: If, Else
- V: Left, Right
- Union: First, Second / Left, Right
- Disjoin: First, Second / Left, Right
- Parity: Even, Odd
