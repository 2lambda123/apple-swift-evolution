## Introduction

Property Wrappers were [introduced in Swift 5.1](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md), and have since become a popular feature abstracting away common accessor patterns for properties. Currently, applying a property wrapper is solely permitted at local and type context. However, with increasing adoption, demand for extending _where_ property wrappers can be applied has emerged. This proposal aims to extend property wrappers to function and closure parameters.


## Motivation

Property wrappers have undoubtably been very successful. Applying a property wrapper to a property is enabled by an incredibly lightweight and expressive syntax. Therefore, library authors can expose complex behavior through easily understandable property-wrapper types in an efficient manner. For instance, frameworks such as [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/) and [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) introduce property wrappers such as [`State`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state), [`Binding`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding) and [`Published`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published) respectively, to expose elaborate behavior through a succinct interface, helping craft expressive yet simple APIs. However, property wrappers are only applicable to local and type properties, shattering the illusion that they helped realize in the first place:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Clamped<Bound: Comparable> {

  init(
    wrappedValue: Bound,
    to range: ClosedRange<Bound>
  ) { ... }
  
  
  var wrappedValue: Bound { 
    get { ... }
    set { ... }
  }
  
}


struct Percentage {

  @Clamped(to: 0 ... 100)
  var percent = 0
     
     
  mutating func increment() {
    percent += 1
    // Great!
  }

  mutating func adding(_ offset: Int) {
    percent += min(100, max(0, offset))
    //         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // We are forced to manually clamp 'offset' 
    // instead of utilizing the abstraction 
    // property wrappers offer.
  }

  mutating func adding(_ offset: Clamped<Int>) {
    //                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // Unfortunately, we can't use 
    // '@Clamped(to: 0 ... 100)' here.
    
    percent += offset.wrappedValue
    //               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // We must access 'wrappedValue' manually.
  }
  
}
```

As seen in the above example, it is quite awkward and unintuitive that property wrappers cannot be applied to function parameters. In this case, a property wrapper parameter would be useful for expressing and enforcing invariants about the `offset` argument to the `adding` method on `Percentage`. Inability to allow the `@Clamped` attribute on the `offset` parameter causes the API author to choose between making invariant checking an implementation detail, or forcing the invariant checking on every caller of the API.

This limitation in expressivity is emphasized by the fact that property wrappers were originally sought out to abstract away such patterns.  As a result, elegant APIs are undermined by this limitation. Not only is this limiting users by forcing them to carefully read documentation, which may not cover a specific use case, to make sure no invariants have been violated, but it also limits API authors in what they can create. That is, API authors can't use property-wrapper types in closure parameters nor can code be separated into functions that accept property wrapper syntax:

```swift
extension Percentage {

  func modify(
    inSeconds seconds: Int,
    block: @escaping (inout Clamped<Int>) -> Void
  ) { ... }
  
}


let myPercentage = Percentage(percent: 50)

myPercentage
  .modify(inSeconds: 3) { percent in
    percent.wrappedValue = 100
    //    ^~~~~~~~~~~~ 
    // Again, we have to access
    // count through 'wrappedValue'.
  }
```

In fact, establishing custom behavior on closure parameters is really powerful. For example, if such a feature were supported, it could be used in conjunction with [Result Builders](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0289-result-builders.md) to expose data managed by a 'component' type. For instance, in SwiftUI [`ForEach`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/foreach) could leverage this feature to expose the mutable state of its data source to its 'content' closure. This would enable users to more easily work with the data source itself inside the closure instead of accessing the original property, which is particularly painful when working with collections, as shown in this example:

```swift
struct MyView: View {

  // A simple Shopping Item that includes
  // a 'quantity' and a 'name' property.
  @State 
  private var shoppingItems: [Item]


  var body: some View {
    ForEach(0 ..< shoppingItems.count) { index in
  
      TextField("Enter the item's name...", $shoppingItems[index].name)
      
    }
  }
  
}
```

we would — with an appropriate initializer — be able to simplify the above code, reducing boilerplate as a result:

```swift
struct MyView: View {

  @State 
  private var shoppingItems: [Item]


  var body: some View {
    ForEach($shoppingItems) { @Binding shoppingItem in
    
      TextField("Enter the item's name...", $shoppingItem.name)
      
    }
  }
  
}
```


## Proposed solution

We propose to extend the contexts where application of property-wrapper types is permitted. Namely, application of such types will be allowed on function and closure parameters:


## Detailed design

Property wrappers are essentially sugar wrapping a given property with compiler synthesized code. This proposal retains this principle employing the following rules for transformation.

### Property Wrappers on Function Parameters

Function parameters marked with a set of compatible property-wrapper custom attributes must conform to the following rules:

1. Property wrapper function parameters must support initialization through their `wrappedValue` type. Therefore, all property-wrapper types must provide a suitable `init(wrappedValue:)`.
2. Each `wrappedValue` getter shall be `nonmutating`.
3. Default values for such parameters must be expressed in terms of the innermost `wrappedValue` type.

Transformation of property-wrapper parameters will be performed as such:

1. The argument label will remain unchanged.
2. The parameter name will be prefixed with an underscore.
3. The parameter will be bound to the backing property wrapper type.
4. A local computed property representing  `wrappedValue` will be synthesized by the compiler and named per the original (non-prefixed) parameter name. The accessors will mirror the `wrappedValue` accessors. A setter will only be synthesized for the local property if the `wrappedValue` setter is `nonmutating`, or if the wrapper is a reference type.
5. If the property wrapper defines a `projectedValue`, a local computed property representing  `projectedValue` will be synthesized by the compiler and named per the original parameter name prefixed with a dollar sign (`$`). The same accessor rules for `wrappedValue` apply to `projectedValue`.
6. When passing an argument to a property wrapper parameter, the compiler will wrap the argument in the appropriate `init(wrappedValue:)` call.

#### Transformation Example:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Lowercased {

  init(wrappedValue: String) { ... }
    
    
  var wrappedValue: String {
    get { ... }
    set { ... }
  }
  
}

func postUrl(
  @Lowercased urlString: String
) { ... }


postUrl(urlString: "mySite.xyz/myUnformattedUsErNAme")
```

In the above code, the `postUrl(urlString:)` function and its caller are equivalent to:

```swift
func postUrl(urlString _urlString: Lowercased) {

  var urlString: String {
    get { _ urlString.wrappedValue }
    // The setter accessor is not synthesized
    // because the setter of the 'wrappedValue' 
    // property of 'Lowercased' is mutating.
  }


  ...
  
}


postUrl(urlString: Lowercased(wrappedValue: "mySite.xyz/myUnformattedUsErNAme"))
```

#### Restrictions on Property Wrapper Function Parameters

##### `@autoclosure`

Function parameters with a property wrapper custom attribute cannot have an `@autoclosure` type. `@autoclosure` is unnecessary for the wrapped value itself because the wrapped value argument at the call-site will always be wrapped in a call to `init(wrappedValue:)`, which already can support `@autoclosure` arguments. Using `@autoclosure` for the backing wrapper type would be misleading, because the type spelled out for the parameter would not be the true autoclosure type. Consider the `reportProgress` example from above with an `@autoclosure` parameter:

```swift
func postUrl(
  @Lowercased urlString: @autoclosure () -> String
) { ... }


postUrl(urlString: "mySite.xyz/myUnformattedUsErNAme")
```
The above code would be transformed to:
```swift
func postUrl(
  urlString _urlString: @autoclosure () -> Lowercased
) { ... }


postUrl(urlString: Lowercased(wrappedValue: "mySite.xyz/myUnformattedUsErNAme"))
```
The changing type of the `@autoclosure` is incredibly misleading, as it's not obvious that `@autoclosure` applies to the backing wrapper rather than the wrapped value. Therefore, using `@autoclosure` for a property wrapper function parameter will be a compiler error.


### Property Wrappers on Closure Parameters

Since a property wrapper custom attribute is applied directly to the declaration that will be wrapped, application of a property wrapper type is only available within a closure expression. That is, the signature of a function that contains a closure cannot include the property wrapper attribute. Instead the application of the attribute will be up to the caller of the function, which supplies the closure argument.

Closure parameters marked with a set of property wrapper custom attributes must conform to the following rules:

1. Each wrapper attribute must not specify any arguments.
2. Each `wrappedValue` getter shall be `nonmutating`.
3. Any contextual type for the parameter must match the outermost backing wrapper type.

The transformation of a property wrapper closure parameter will take place as follows:

1. The parameter name will be prefixed with an underscore.
2. The parameter will be bound to the backing property wrapper type.
3. A local computed property representing  `wrappedValue` will be synthesized by the compiler and named per the original (non-prefixed) parameter name. The accessors will mirror the `wrappedValue` accessors. A setter will only be synthesized for the local property if the `wrappedValue` setter is `nonmutating`, or if the wrapper is a reference type.
4. If the property wrapper defines a `projectedValue`, a local computed property representing  `projectedValue` will be synthesized by the compiler and named per the original parameter name prefixed with a dollar sign (`$`). The same accessor rules for `wrappedValue` apply to `projectedValue`.

#### Transformation Example:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Reference<Value> {

  init(
    getter: @escaping () -> Value,
    setter: @escaping (Value) -> Void
  ) { ... }
    
    
  var wrappedValue: Value {
    get 
    nonmutating set
  }
    
  var projectedValue: Self {
    self
  }
  
}

typealias A = (Reference<Int>) -> Void

let a: A = { @Reference reference in
  ...
}
```

In the above example, the closure `a` is equivalent to:

```swift
let a: A = { (_reference: Reference<Int>) in

  var reference: Int {
    get { 
      _reference.wrappedValue
    }
    set { 
      _reference.wrappedValue = newValue
    }
  }

  var $reference: Int {
    get { 
      _reference.projectedValue
    }
  }
    
    
  ...
  
}
```

## Source compatibility

This is an additive change with no impact on source compatibility.

## Effect on ABI stability

This is an additive change with no impact on the existing ABI.

## Effect on API resilience

This proposal introduces the need for property wrapper custom attributes to become part of public API. A property wrapper applied to a function parameter changes the type of that parameter in the ABI, and it changes the way that function callers are compiled to pass an argument of that type. Thus, adding or removing a property wrapper on a public function parameter is an ABI-breaking change.

## Alternatives Considered

### Allow Property Wrapper Attributes as Type Attributes

One approach for marking closure parameters as property wrappers is to allow property wrapper custom attributes to be applied to types, such as:

```swift
func useReference(
  _ closure: (@Reference reference: Int) -> Void
) { ... }


useReference { reference in
  ...
}
```

This approach enables inference of the wrapper attribute on the closure parameter from context. However, this breaks the property wrapper declaration model, and it would force callers into the property wrapper syntax. This approach also raises questions about anonymous closure parameters that have an inferred property wrapper custom attribute. If an anonymous closure parameter `$0` has the `wrappedValue` type, accessing the backing wrapper and projected value would naturally use `_$0` and `$$0`, which are far from readable. If `$0` has the backing wrapper type, this would mean that naming the parameter would cause the value to change types, which is very unexpected for the user. Finally, the property wrapper syntax is purely implementation detail for the closure body, which does not belong in the API signature.


## Future Directions

### Support Property Wrapper Initialization from a Projected Value

Today, a property wrapper can be initialized from an instance of its `wrappedValue` type if the wrapper provides a suitable `init(wrappedValue:)`. The same initialization strategy is used in this proposal for property wrapper parameters to allow users to pass a wrapped value as a property wrapper argument. We could extend this model to support initializing a property wrapper from an instance of its `projectedValue` type by allowing property wrappers to define an `init(projectedValue:)` that follows the same rules as `init(wrappedValue:)`. This could allow users to additionally pass a projected value as a property wrapper argument, like so:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Clamped<Value: Comparable> {

  ...
  

  init(projectedValue: Self) { ... }
  
}

func distanceFromUpperBound(
  @Clamped clamped: Int
) { ... }


distanceFromUpperBound(
  $clamped: Clamped(to: 0 ... 100, wrappedValue: 30)
) // returns: 70
```


### Add Support for `inout` Wrapped Parameters is Functions

This proposal doesn't currently support marking function parameters to which wrapper types have been applied `inout`. We deemed that this functionality would be better tackled by another proposal due to its implementation complexity. However, such a feature would be really useful for wrapper types with value semantics and it would simplify the mental model. Furthermore, it could alleviate some confusion for users that don't understand the difference between a setter with value semantics and one with reference semantics.


### Accessing Enclosing Self from Wrapper Types

There's currently no public feature that allows a wrapper to access its enclosing `Self` type:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Mirror<EnclosingSelf, Value, Path>
  where Path : KeyPath<EnclosingSelf, Value> { 
  
  let keyPath: Path 


  init(of keyPath: Path) { ... }
  
}


struct Point {

  private var _vector: SIMD2<Double>
  
  
  init(x: Double, y: Double) {
    self._vector = SIMD2(x: x, y: y)
  }
  
  
  @Mirror(of: \._vector.x)
  var x
  
  @Mirror(of: \._vector.y)
  var y
  
} ❌
// In the above use, we'd access the enclosing
// type's '_vector' property through the provided
// keyPath. However, today that's invalid.
```

Furthermore, extending this feature's availability to function and closure parameters be really powerful:

```swift
func valueAndIdPair<Value>(
  @Mirror of property: Value
) -> (value: Value, id: Int) {
  (value: property, id: $property.keyPath.hashValue)
}
```

It's important to note that allowing use of such a feature in function parameters would entail some limitations. For example, a parameter marked with a wrapper type referencing enclosing `self` would be an error for a non-instance method, as the accessors for the `wrappedValue` and `projectedValue` need an enclosing `self` instance.

### Add Wrapper Types in the Standard Library

Adding wrapper types to the Standard Library has been discussed for types [such as `@Atomic`](https://forums.swift.org/t/atomic-property-wrapper-for-standard-library/30468) and [`@Weak`](https://forums.swift.org/t/should-weak-be-a-type/34032), which would facilitate certain APIs. Another interesting Standard Library wrapper type could be `@UnsafePointer`, which would be quite useful, as access of the `pointee` property is quite common:

```swift
let myPointer: UnsafePointer<UInt8> = ...

myPointer.pointee 
//        ^~~~~~~ 
// This is the accessor pattern property 
// wrappers were devised to tackle.
```

Instead of writing the above, in the future one might be able to write this:

```swift
let myInt = 0

withUnsafePointer(to: ...) { @UnsafePointer value in

  print(value) // 0
  
  $value.withMemoryRebound(to: UInt64.self) {
    ... 
  }
  
}
```

As a result, unsafe code is not dominated by visually displeasing accesses to `pointee` members; rather, more natural and clear code is enabled. 

What's more, a `@Lazy` type could be added so as to alleviate the need for custom behavior built into the compiler. Instead, `@Lazy` would act as more comprehensible, easy to maintain type, that would also allow for a more streamlined way of resetting its storage:

```
struct Size {
    
    private mutating func _reset() {
        $__lazy_storage_$_area = nil
    }
    
    var width: Double {
        didSet {
            _reset()
        }
    }
  
    var height: Double {
        didSet {
            _reset()
        }
    }
  
  
    // Mutation of 'width' and 'height' are rare;
    // therefore, it is sensible that the commonly
    // accessed 'area' property be lazy.
    lazy var area = width * height
  
}
```

The above code shows how one would currently implement a `Size` type with such semantics. With `@Lazy`, though, it would be simplified to:

```
struct Size {
    
  @Lazy {
    width * height
  }
  var area: Double


  var width: Double {
    didSet {
      $area.reset()
    }
  }

  var height: Double {
    didSet {
      $area.reset()
    }
  }
  
}
```

Here, resetting of `area`'s underlying storage is very clear and easily accessible through `@Lazy`'s projected value.
