## Introduction

[SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md) introduced a computed variable and initializer surrounding the concept of an `encodedOffset`. Unfortunately, that approach is flawed for its intended purpose, and is commonly misused in ways that Swift 5 is [more likely to expose](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9749). We propose a set of alternative APIs for each intended use and every existing misuse.

## Motivation

String abstracts away details about the underlying encoding used in its storage. String.Index is opaque and represents a position within a String or Substring. This can make serializing a string alongside its indices difficult, and for that reason [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md) added a computed variable and initializer `encodedOffset` in Swift 4.0.

String was always meant to be capable of handling multiple backing encodings for its contents, and this is realized in Swift 5. [String now uses UTF-8](https://forums.swift.org/t/string-s-abi-and-utf-8/17676) for its preferred “fast” native encoding, but has a resilient fallback for strings of different encodings. Currently, we only use this fall-back for lazily-bridged Cocoa strings, which are commonly encoded as UTF-16, though it can be extended in the future thanks to resilience.

Unfortunately, [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)’s approach of a single notion of `encodedOffset` is flawed. A string can be serialized with a choice of encodings, and the offset is therefore encoding-dependent and requires access to the contents of the string to calculate. A comment in [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)'s example source mentioned that `encodedOffset` assumes UTF-16, which happened to be the only encoding used internally by String at the time (for offset purposes).

Furthermore, the majority of uses of `encodedOffset` in the wild are not following [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)’s intended purpose and are sensitive to encoding changes. `encodedOffset` is frequently misused under the assumption that all Characters are comprised of a single code unit, which is error-prone and Swift 5 might surface the underlying bugs in more situations. It is also sometimes used for mapping Cocoa string indices, which happens to work in Swift 4 but might not in Swift 5, and Foundation already provides better alternatives.

Because Swift 5 may introduce a semantic difference in behavior, it is important to rush this fix into the 5.0 release so that developers can preserve existing semantics or switch to correct semantics as needed. We hope the majority of existing uses will be replaced with something more ergonomic such as [offset-based subscripting](https://forums.swift.org/t/shorthand-for-offsetting-startindex-and-endindex/9397) in a future release, but we need some migration path for code now.


## Proposed solution

We propose fixing all existing use and misuse scenarios by adding per-view offset initializers and methods to `String.Index`, in addition to one for the default view of Characters. We propose deprecating `encodedOffset` to direct existing code towards these replacements.

<details><summary>Details: String’s views and encodings</summary>

String has 3 views which correspond to the most popular Unicode encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 (via the Unicode scalar values). String’s default view is of Characters.

```swift
let myString = "abc\r\nいろは"
Array(myString.utf8) // UTF-8 encoded
Array(myString.utf16) // UTF-16 encoded
Array(myString.unicodeScalars.lazy.map { $0.value }) // UTF-32 encoded
Array(myString); Array(myString.indices) // Not an encoding, but provides offset-based access to `Characters`
```
</details>

### Uses in the Wild
<details>

GitHub code search yields [nearly 1500 uses](https://github.com/search?l=Swift&q=encodedOffset&type=Code) , and nearly-none of them are for [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)’s intended purpose. Below I present the 3 most common uses.

```swift
// Common code for these examples
let myString: String = ...
let start: String.Index = ...
let end: String.Index = ...
let utf16OffsetRange: Range<Int> = ...
let nsRange: NSRange = ...
```


#### Offset-based `Character` indexing

The most common misuse of `encodedOffset` assumes that all Characters in a String are comprised of a single code unit. This is wrong and a source of surprising bugs, even for exclusively ASCII content: `"\r\n".count == 1`.

```swift
let (i, j): (Int, Int) = ... // Something computed in terms of myString.count

// Problematic code
myString[String.Index(encodedOffset: i]..<String.Index(encodedOffset: j)]

// Semantic preserving alternative from this proposal
myString[String.Index(offset: i, within: myString)..<String.Index(offset: j, within: myString)]

// Even better alternative
let myIndices = Array(myString.indices)
let (i, j): (Int, Int) = ... // Something computed in terms of myIndices.count
myString[myIndices[i]..<myIndices[j]]
```


#### Range Mapping

Many of the uses in the wild are trying to map between `Range<String.Index>` and `NSRange`. Foundation already provides convenient initializers for this purpose already, and using them is the preferred approach:

```swift
// Problematic code
let myNSRange = NSRange(location: start.encodedOffset, length: end.encodedOffset - start.encodedOffset)
let myStrRange = String.Index(encodedOffset: nsRange.lowerBound)..<String.Index(encodedOffset: nsRange.upperBound)

// Better alternative
let myNSRange = NSRange(start..<end, in: myString)
let myStrRange = Range(nsRange, in: myString)
```


#### Naked Ints

Some uses in the wild, through no fault of their own, have an Int which represents a position in UTF-16 encoded contents and need to convert that to a `String.Index`.


```swift
// Problematic code
let strLower = String.Index(encodedOffset: utf16OffsetRange.lowerBound)
let strUpper = String.Index(encodedOffset: utf16OffsetRange.upperBound)
let subStr = myString[strLower..<strUpper]

// Semantic preserving alternative from this proposal
let strLower = String.Index(offset: utf16OffsetRange.lowerBound, within: str.utf16)
let strUpper = String.Index(offset: utf16OffsetRange.upperBound, within: str.utf16)
let subStr = myString[strLower..<strUpper]
```

</details>


## Detailed design

```swift
extension String.Index {
  /// The UTF-16 code unit offset corresponding to this Index
  public func offset(within utf16: String.UTF16View) -> Int {
    return utf16.distance(from: utf16.startIndex, to: self)
  }
  /// The UTF-8 code unit offset corresponding to this Index
  public func offset(within utf8: String.UTF8View) -> Int {
    return utf8.distance(from: utf8.startIndex, to: self)
  }
  /// The Unicode scalar offset corresponding to this Index
  public func offset(within scalars: String.UnicodeScalarView) -> Int {
    return scalars.distance(from: scalars.startIndex, to: self)
  }
  /// The Character offset corresponding to this Index
  public func offset(within str: String) -> Int {
    return str.distance(from: str.startIndex, to: self)
  }

  /// Creates a new index at the specified UTF-16 code unit offset
  ///
  /// - Parameter offset: An offset in UTF-16 code units.
  public init(offset: Int, within utf16: String.UTF16View) {
    let (start, end) = (utf16.startIndex, utf16.endIndex)
    guard offset >= 0,
          let idx = utf16.index(start, offsetBy: offset, limitedBy: end)
    else {
      self = end
      return
    }
    self = idx
  }

  /// Creates a new index at the specified UTF-8 code unit offset
  ///
  /// - Parameter offset: An offset in UTF-8 code units.
  public init(offset: Int, within utf8: String.UTF8View) {
    let (start, end) = (utf8.startIndex, utf8.endIndex)
    guard offset >= 0,
          let idx = utf8.index(start, offsetBy: offset, limitedBy: end)
    else {
      self = end
      return
    }
    self = idx
  }

  /// Creates a new index at the specified Unicode scalar offset
  ///
  /// - Parameter offset: An offset in terms of Unicode.Scalars
  public init(offset: Int, within scalars: String.UnicodeScalarView) {
    let (start, end) = (scalars.startIndex, scalars.endIndex)
    guard offset >= 0,
          let idx = scalars.index(start, offsetBy: offset, limitedBy: end)
    else {
      self = end
      return
    }
    self = idx
  }

  /// Creates a new index at the specified Character offset
  ///
  /// - Parameter offset: An offset in terms of Characters
  public init(offset: Int, within str: String) {
    let (start, end) = (str.startIndex, str.endIndex)
    guard offset >= 0,
          let idx = str.index(start, offsetBy: offset, limitedBy: end)
    else {
      self = end
      return
    }
    self = idx
  }
}

```

This gives developers:

1. The ability to choose a specific encoding for serialization, the original intended purpose.
2. The ability to fix any code that assumed fixed-encoding-width Characters by choosing the most-natural variant that just takes a String.
3. The ability to migrate their uses for Cocoa index mapping by choosing UTF-16.


## Source Compatibility

This deprecates existing API and provides alternatives. Deprecation preserves source compatibility and strongly hints towards correct usage. But, other changes in Swift 5 introduce potential semantic drift.

## Effect of ABI stability

This change is necessary to realize our goal of opaque String indices and an encoding-abstracted String representation in time for ABI stability in Swift 5.

## Effect on API resilience

Added APIs are all resilient and can be replaced with more efficient implementations that preserve correctness as String evolves.

## Alternatives Considered

### Do Nothing

If `encodedOffset` was only used for serialization, *and* such serialization/deserialization would record and preserve the original encoding, *and* we amend [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)’s comment to avoid nailing it down to any given encoding, no change would be necessary. Unfortunately, there is no way to query or preserve internal encoding and there is considerable use and misuse in the wild, as mentioned in the “Uses in the Wild” disclosure section.
