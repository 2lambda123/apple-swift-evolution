# Type-based Private Access Level

* Proposal: [SE-XXXX](XXXX-typed-based-private.md)
* Authors: [David Hart](http://github.com/hartbit)
* Review Manager: TBD
* Status: TBD

## Introduction

This proposal extends the visibility of the `private` access level to all extensions, declarations and nested types in the same file.

## Motivation

Proposal [SE-0025](0025-scoped-access-level.md) introduced a lexically-scoped access level named `private` and renamed the file-based access level to `fileprivate`. The hope was for `private` to be a good default for restricting visibility further than the whole module and for `fileprivate` to be used in rarer occasions when that restriction needed to be loosened.

Unfortunately, that goal of the proposal has not been realized: Swift's reliance on extensions as a grouping and conformance mechanism has made `fileprivate` more necessary than expected and has caused more friction between `private` and `fileprivate` than intended.

As a consequence, experience with using Swift 3 has caused mixed reactions from the mailing list and greater Swift community, culminating in proposal [SE-0159](0159-fix-private-access-levels.md) which suggested reverting the access level changes. That proposal was rejected to continue supporting the code written since Swift 3 which benefits from the distinction between `private` and `fileprivate`, but it was recognized that the language's lack of a good default access level more restictive than `internal` was unfortunate.

In the hopes of fulfilling the initial goal of [SE-0025](0025-scoped-access-level.md), this proposal defines the visibility of the `private` access level to extensions, declarations and nested types of the member's type in the same file to increase its usefulness and as a good default private access level. `fileprivate` then logically achieves its intended goal of being more rarely used and adheres to Swift's "progressive disclosure‚Äù philosophy.

While it has been argued that access level changes should wait until a future design of submodules, the increasing importance of source stability in Swift severly diminishes that argument. Changes of the level of those described in this proposal will most probably be impossible post Swift 4, making this the last chance of correcting the deficiencies of [SE-0025](0025-scoped-access-level.md).

## Detailed design

The design of this proposal defines the visibility of a `private` member declared within a type `X` or an extension of type `X` to:

* the declaration of `X` if it occurs in the same file
* all extensions of `X` in the same file
* all declarations of nested types of `X` in the same file
* all extensions of nested types of `X` in the same file

To illustrate the consequence of those rules, the following examples will be used with two files in the same module:

### Person.swift

```swift
struct Person {
    let name: String
    let gender: Gender
    private let age: String

    var greeting {
        return "Hello, my name is \(name)"
    }

    init(name: String, gender: Gender, age: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }

    func greet() {
        // age is accessible because it is defined in the same declaration
        // secretAge is not because it is defined in a nested type
        // Therefore, following piece of code would generate a compilation error:
        // if age < gender.secrecyAge {
        
        // Instead:
        if Gender.shouldRevealAge(self) {
            // fullGreeting is accessible because it is defined in an extension
            // of the same type in the same file
            print(fullGreeting)
        } else {
            print(greeting)
        }
    }
}

// private at the top-level scope continues to be equivalent to fileprivate
private extension Person {
    // fullGreeting is implictly private due to the extension's modifier
    var fullGreeting: String {
        // age is accessible because it is defined in the declaration of the extension's type in the
        // same file
        return "Hello, my name is \(name), I'm \(age) years old."
    }
}

extension Person {
    enum Gender {
        case male
        case female

        private var secrecyAge: Int {
            switch self {
            case .male: return 60
            case .female: return 50
            }
        }

        static func shouldRevealAge(_ person: Person) -> Bool {
            // age is accessible because it was declared in the same file and we are
            // in the declaration of a type nested in the type that declared age
            return person.age < person.gender.secrecyAge
        }
    }
}

extension Gender {
    static func leakAge(of person: Person) {
        // age is accessible because we are in the extension of a type nested in the
        // type same file
        return person.age
    }
}
```

### Other.swift

```swift
extension Person : CustomStringConvertible {
    var desription: String {
        return fullGreeting
        // error: fullGreeting is not available because it is defined in another file
    }
}
```

## Source compatibility

In Swift 3 compatibility mode, the compiler will continue to treat `private` as before. In Swift 4 mode, the compiler will modify the semantics of `private` to follow the rules of this proposal. No migration will be necessary as this proposal merely broadens the visibility of `private`.

Cases where a type had `private` declarations with the same signature in the same type/extension but in different scopes will produce a compiler error in Swift 4. For example, the following piece of code compiles in Swift 3 compatibilty mode but generates a `Invalid redeclaration of 'bar()'` error in Swift 4 mode:

```swift
struct Foo {
    private func bar() {}
}

extension Foo {
    private func bar() {}
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

The alternative to this proposals which tried to solve the same goal was [SE-0159](0159-fix-private-access-levels.md). That proposal was rejected.
