## Introduction

This proposal lets Swift Package authors declare targets as executable in the
package manifest. This replaces the current approach of inferring executabilty
based on the presence of a source file with the base name "main" at the top
level of the target source directory.

Letting package authors declare targets as executable allows the use of `@main`
in Swift package targets. It also allows for better diagnostics, since the
purpose of the target is unambiguous even if source files are moved or renamed.

## Motivation

The Swift Package Manager doesn’t currently provide a way for a package manifest
to declare that a target provides the main module for an executable. Instead,
SwiftPM infers this by looking for a compilable source file with a base name of
`main` at the top level of the target directory.

It is important to know unambiguously whether or not a target is intended to be
executable, because it affects the flags that are passed to the compiler at
build time. It also affects the quality of diagnostics, such as detecting
product declarations that mistakenly include more or less than a single
executable target in an executable product.

Relying on specially named source files also doesn’t work when using `@main` to
specify the entry point of an executable. In addition, there are ergonomic
problems with using specially named source files (e.g.
[SR-1379](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1379)) that would be addressed by
being able to explicitly declare a target as being executable in the manifest.

## Proposed solution

The most straightforward approach is to allow a target to be marked as
executable in the manifest. This could take the form of either a parameter to
the existing `target` type, or a new target type.

There is already an established pattern of using the type itself to denote the
kind of target being declared (e.g. `testTarget` as a specialization of
`target`), so this proposal suggests adding a new `executableTarget` type for
this purpose.

Using a separate target type in the manifest would also support any future
differences in parameters between an executable target and a library target.
It would also be easier to read in a package manifest that includes a long
list of target declarations.

## Detailed design

The `PackageDescription` API will be updated to add an `executableTarget`
function, currently having the same parameters as the `target` function:

     /// Creates an executable target.
     ///
     /// An executable target can contain either Swift or C-family source files, but not both. It contains code that
     /// is built as an executable module that can be used as the main target of an executable product.  The target
     /// is expected to either have a source file named `main.swift`, `main.m`, `main.c`, or `main.cpp`, or a source
     ///  file that contains the `@main` keyword.
     ///
     /// - Parameters:
     ///   - name: The name of the target.
     ///   - dependencies: The dependencies of the target. A dependency can be another target in the package or a product from a package dependency.
     ///   - path: The custom path for the target. By default, the Swift Package Manager requires a target's sources to reside at predefined search paths;
     ///       for example, `[PackageRoot]/Sources/[TargetName]`.
     ///       Don't escape the package root; for example, values like `../Foo` or `/Foo` are invalid.
     ///   - exclude: A list of paths to files or directories that the Swift Package Manager shouldn't consider to be source or resource files.
     ///       A path is relative to the target's directory.
     ///       This parameter has precedence over the `sources` parameter.
     ///   - sources: An explicit list of source files. If you provide a path to a directory,
     ///       the Swift Package Manager searches for valid source files recursively.
     ///   - resources: An explicit list of resources files.
     ///   - publicHeadersPath: The directory containing public headers of a C-family library target.
     ///   - cSettings: The C settings for this target.
     ///   - cxxSettings: The C++ settings for this target.
     ///   - swiftSettings: The Swift settings for this target.
     ///   - linkerSettings: The linker settings for this target.
     @available(_PackageDescription, introduced: 999.0)
     public static func executableTarget(
        name: String,
        dependencies: [Dependency] = [],
        path: String? = nil,
        exclude: [String] = [],
        sources: [String]? = nil,
        resources: [Resource]? = nil,
        publicHeadersPath: String? = nil,
        cSettings: [CSetting]? = nil,
        cxxSettings: [CXXSetting]? = nil,
        swiftSettings: [SwiftSetting]? = nil,
        linkerSettings: [LinkerSetting]? = nil
     ) -> Target {
        return Target(
            name: name,
            dependencies: dependencies,
            path: path,
            exclude: exclude,
            sources: sources,
            resources: resources,
            publicHeadersPath: publicHeadersPath,
            type: .executable,
            cSettings: cSettings,
            cxxSettings: cxxSettings,
            swiftSettings: swiftSettings,
            linkerSettings: linkerSettings
        )
     }

A new `.executable` case is also added to the `TargetType` enum in the
`PackageDescription` API.

These are the only changes that are visible to package manifest authors.

On the implementation side, this proposal updates the logic in SwiftPM so that:

- if the package tools version is 5.3 or earlier, a target is considered to be
  executable using the same rules as in SwiftPM 5.3
- if the package tools version is newer than 5.3, only the target type
  determines whether the target is treated as an exeutable or a library target

SwiftPM already passes different flags when compiling executable targets and
library targets, and that remains unchanged. In particular, SwiftPM passes
`-parse-as-library` when compiling a non-executable target, and will continue
to do so with these changes.

## Impact on exisiting packages

There is no impact on existing packages. Packages that specify a tools version
newer than 5.3 will get the new behavior. A package graph can contain a mixture
of old and new packages, with each package determining a target's executableness
according to the tools version for that package.

As with any Swift module, the Swift compiler will not let an executable have
multiple `@main` entry points, including one that is specified by having a
`main.swift` source file in the target.

## Alternatives considered

There are various other ways of designating a target as executable:

#### As a new parameter on `target`

Target declaration functions already have many parameters, and this would
exacerbate that problem. It would also make it difficult to syntactically
distinguish between executable targets and library targets in the package
manifest. It would also make it difficult to add future parameters that
applied to only library targets or executable targets.

#### Through some other designation outside the manifest

Since the intended executability of a target is an fundamental statement of
purpose, it seems logical that this should be denoted in the package manifest.
The Swift package manifest provides all the information other than what can be
inferred from the file system.

## Future directions

It is somewhat redundant that a package having only a single executable target
that builds a single executable product will now have both a product and target
with the word "executable" in its name. This is mitigated by the existing Swift
Package Manager behavior of implicitly creating an executable product for any
executable target if there isn't already a product with the same name (this
behavior remains unchanged by this proposal).

Since a future goal is to find a way to unify product and target declarations
in the package manifest, this is expected to be only a short-term issue.
