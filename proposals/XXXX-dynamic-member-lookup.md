# Introduce User-defined "Dynamic Member Lookup" Types

* Proposal: [SE-NNNN](NNNN-DynamicMemberLookup.md)
* Author: [Chris Lattner](https://github.com/lattner)
* Review Manager: TBD
* Implementation: [PR13361](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13361)
* Status: **Pending Review**

## Introduction

This proposal introduces a new `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol` type to the standard
library.  Types that conform to it provide "dot" syntax for arbitrary names which are resolved
at runtime - in a **completely type safe** way.  It is simple syntactic sugar which has a
non-invasive implementation in the compiler.  It allows the user to write:

```swift
    a = someValue.someMember
    someValue.someMember = a
    mutateParameter(&someValue.someMember)
````

and have it be interpreted by the compiler as:

```swift
  a = someValue[dynamicMember: "someMember"]
  someValue[dynamicMember: "someMember"] = a
  mutateParameter(&someValue[dynamicMember: "someMember"])
```

Many other languages have analogous features e.g., the `[dynamic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/dynamic-language-runtime-overview)` feature in C#, the composition of Objective-C's
[explicit properties](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/DeclaredProperty.html) and underlying [messaging infrastructure](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtHowMessagingWorks.html)).  This sort
of functionality is great for implementing dynamic language interoperability, dynamic
[proxy APIs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtForwarding.html), and other APIs (e.g. for JSON processing).

Swift-evolution thread: [Discussion thread topic for that proposal](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/)

## Motivation and Context

Swift is well known for being exceptional at interworking with existing C and Objective-C
APIs, but its support for calling APIs written in scripting languages like Python, Perl, and Ruby
is quite lacking.

C and Objective-C are integrated into Swift by expending a heroic amount of effort into
integrating Clang ASTs, remapping existing APIs in an attempt to feel "Swifty", and by
providing a large number of attributes and customization points for changing the behavior
of this integration when writing an Objective-C header. The end result of this massive
investment of effort is that Swift provides a *better* experience when programming against
these legacy APIs than Objective-C itself did.

When considering the space of dynamic languages, four things are clear: 1) there are several
different languages of interest, and they each have significant interest in different quarters:
for example, Python is big in data science and machine learning, Ruby is popular for building
server side apps, a few people apparently use Javascript, and even Perl is in still widely used.
2) These languages have decades of library building behind them, sometimes with [significant
communities](https://pandas.pydata.org) and 3) there are one or two orders of magnitude
more users of these libraries than there are people currently using Swift. 4) APIs written in
these languages will never feel "Swifty", both because of serious differences between the
type systems of Swift and these languages, and because of runtime issues like the Python
GIL.

While it is theoretically possible to expend the same level of effort on each of these languages
and communities as has been spent on Objective-C, it is quite clear that this would both
ineffective as well as bad for Swift: It would be ineffective, because the Swift community has
no leverage over these communities to force auditing and annotation of their APIs.  It would
be bad for Swift because it would require a ton of language-specific support (and a number
of third-party dependencies) of the compiler and runtime, each of which makes the
implementation significantly more complex, difficult to reason about, difficult to maintain, and
difficult to test the supported permutations.  In short, we'd end up with a mess.

Fortunately for us, these scripting languages provide an extremely dynamic programming
model where almost everything is discovered at runtime, and many of them are explicitly
designed to be embedded into other languages and applications.  This aspect allows us to
embed APIs from these languages directly into Swift with [no language support at
all](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171113/041463.html) -
without the level of effort, integration, and invasiveness that Objective-C has benefited
from.  Instead of invasive importer work, we can write some language-specific Swift APIs,
and leave the interop details to that library.

This offers a significant opportunity for us - the Swift community can "embrace" these
dynamic language APIs (making them directly available in Swift) reducing the pain of
someone moving from one of those languages into Swift.  It is true that the APIs thus
provided will not feel "Swifty", but if that becomes a significant problem for any one API, then
the community behind it can evaluate the problem and come up with a solution (either a Swift
wrapper for the dynamic language, or a from-scratch Swift reimplementation of the desired
API).  In any case, if/when we face this challenge, it will be a good thing: we'll know that
we've won a significant new community of Swift developers.

While it is possible today to import (nearly) arbitrary dynamic language APIs into Swift today,
the resultant API is unusable for two major reasons: member lookup is too verbose to be
acceptable, and calling behavior is similarly too verbose to be acceptable.  As such, we seek
to provide two "syntactic sugar" features that solve this problem.  These sugars are
specifically designed to be independent of the dynamic languages themselves and, indeed,
independent of dynamic languages at all: we can imagine other usage for the same primitive
capabilities.

The two proposals in question are the introduction of `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol` (this
proposal) and a related
[`DynamicCallable`](https://gist.github.com/lattner/a6257f425f55fe39fd6ac7a2354d693d)
protocol.  With these two extensions, we think we can eliminate the need for invasive
importer magic by making interoperability with dynamic languages ergonomic enough to be
acceptable.

For example, consider this Python code:

```Python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.tricks = []    # creates a new empty list for each dog

    def add_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)
```

we would like to be able to use this from Swift like this (the comments show the
corresponding syntax you would use in Python):

```swift
  // import DogModule
  // import DogModule.Dog as Dog    // an alternate
  let Dog = Python.import(â€œDogModule.Dog")

  // dog = Dog("Brianna")
  let dog = Dog("Brianna")

  // dog.add_trick("Roll over")
  dog.add_trick("Roll over")

  // dog2 = Dog("Kaylee").add_trick("snore")
  let dog2 = Dog("Kaylee").add_trick("snore")
```

Of course, this would also apply to standard Python APIs as well.  Here is an example
working with the Python `pickle` API and the builtin Python function `open`:

```swift
  // import pickle
  let pickle = Python.import("pickle")

  // file = open(filename)
  let file = Python.open(filename)

  // blob = file.read()
  let blob = file.read()

  // result = pickle.loads(blob)
  let result = pickle.loads(blob)
```

This can all be expressed today as library functionality written in Swift, but without this
proposal, the code required is unnecessarily verbose and gross. Without it (but *with* the
related [`DynamicCallable` proposal](https://gist.github.com/lattner/a6257f425f55fe39fd6ac7a2354d693d)
the code would have explicit member lookups all over the place:

```swift
  // import pickle
  let pickle = Python.get(member: "import")("pickle")

  // file = open(filename)
  let file = Python.get(member: "open")(filename)

  // blob = file.read()
  let blob = file.get(member: "read")()

  // result = pickle.loads(blob)
  let result = pickle.get(member: "loads")(blob)

  // dog2 = Dog("Kaylee").add_trick("snore")
  let dog2 = Dog("Kaylee").get(member: "add_trick")("snore")
```

While this is a syntactic sugar proposal, we believe that this expands Swift to be usable in
important new domains.  In addition to dynamic language interoperability, this sort of
functionality is useful for other APIs, e.g. when working with dynamically typed unstructured
data like JSON, which could provide an API like `jsonValue?.jsonField1?.jsonField2`
where each field is dynamically looked up.  An example of this is shown below in the
"Example Usage" section.

## Proposed solution

We propose introducing a new protocol to the standard library:

```swift
/// Types type conform to this protocol have the behavior that member lookup -
/// accessing `someval.member` will always succeed.  Failures to find normally
/// declared members of `member` will be turned into subscript references using
/// the `someval[dynamicMember: member]` member.
///
public protocol DynamicMemberLookupProtocol {
  // Implementations of this protocol must have a subscript(dynamicMember:)
  // implementation where the keyword type is some type that is
  // ExpressibleByStringLiteral.  It can be get-only or get/set which defines
  // the mutability of the resultant dynamic properties.

  // subscript<KeywordType: ExpressibleByStringLiteral, LookupValue>
  //   (dynamicMember name: KeywordType) -> LookupValue { get }
}
```

It also extends the language such that member lookup syntax (`x.y`) - when it otherwise fails
(because there is no member `y` defined on the type of `x`) and when applied to a value which
conforms to `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol` - is accepted and
transformed into a call to the subscript in the protocol.  The produced value is a mutable
L-value if the type conforming to `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol` implements a mutable
subscript, or immutable otherwise.  This allows the type to perform arbitrary runtime
processing to calculate the value to return.  The dynamically computed property can be used
the same way as an explicitly declared computed property, including being passed `inout` if
mutable.

The protocol is intentionally designed to be flexible: the implementation can take the member
name through any `ExpressibleByStringLiteral` type, including `StaticString` and of
course `String`.  The result type may also be any type the implementation desires, including
an `Optional`, `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional` or some other type, which allows the
implementation to reflect dynamic failures in a way the user can be expected to process (e.g.,
see the JSON example below).

This protocol is implemented as a "marker protocol" which enables the magic name lookup
behavior, but does not have any explicitly declared requirements within its body.  This is
because Swift's type system doesn't have the ability to directly express the requirements we
have: consider that subscripts can have mutating getters and nonmutating setters.  These
are important to support, because it affects when and if values may be get and set through
a potentially immutable base type.  Alternative implementation approaches were explored,
and are discussed in the "[Alternatives
Considered](#declare-an-explicit-subscript-requirement)" section below.

In the discussion cycle, there was significant concern about abuse of this feature, particularly
if someone retroactively conforms a type to `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol`.  Further,
it is easy to argue that dynamic behavior is a core part of the contract of a type's behavior,
not something that should be changable retroactively.  For
this reason, the compiler only permits conformance of this protocol on the original type
definition, not extensions.  If for some reason there becomes a reason to relax this requirement,
we can evaluate that as a separate proposal based on its own merits.  See the "[Alternatives
Considered](#reducing-potential-abuse)" section below for further ways to reduce
potential for abuse.


## Example Usage

While there are many potential uses of this sort of API one motivating example comes from a
prototype
Python interoperability layer.  There are many ways to implement this, and the details are not
particularly important, but it is perhaps useful to know that this is directly useful to address
the motivation section described above.   Given a currency type of PyVal (and a conforming
implementation named `PyRef`), an implementation may look like:

```swift
extension PyVal : DynamicMemberLookupProtocol {
  subscript(dynamicMember member: String) -> PyVal {
    get {
      let result = PyObject_GetAttrString(borrowedPyObject, member)!
      return PyRef(owned: result)
    }
    set {
      PyObject_SetAttrString(borrowedPyObject, member,
                             newValue.borrowedPyObject)
    }
  }
}
```

Another example use are JSON libraries which represent JSON blobs as a Swift enum, e.g.:

```swift
enum JSON {
  case IntValue(Int)
  case StringValue(String)
  case ArrayValue(Array<JSON>)
  case DictionaryValue(Dictionary<String, JSON>)
}
```

Today, it is not unusual for them to implement members like this to allow drilling down into
the JSON value:

```swift
extension JSON {
  var stringValue : String? {
    if case .StringValue(let str) = self {
      return str
    }
    return nil
  }
  subscript(index: Int) -> JSON? {
    if case .ArrayValue(let arr) = self {
      return index < arr.count ? arr[index] : nil
    }
    return nil
  }
  subscript(key: String) -> JSON? {
    if case .DictionaryValue(let dict) = self {
      return dict[key]
    }
    return nil
  }
}
```

This allows someone to drill into a JSON value with code like:
`json[0]?["name"]?["first"]?.stringValue`.  On the other hand, if we add a simple
conformance to `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol` like this:

```swift
extension JSON : DynamicMemberLookupProtocol {
  subscript(dynamicMember member: String) -> JSON? {
    if case .DictionaryValue(let dict) = self {
      return dict[member]
    }
    return nil
  }
}
```

Now clients are able to write more natural code like:
`json[0]?.name?.first?.stringValue` which is close to the expressivity of Javascript...
while being fully type safe!


## Source compatibility

This is a strictly additive proposal with no source breaking changes.

## Effect on ABI stability

This is a strictly additive proposal with no ABI breaking changes.

## Effect on API resilience

Types that conform to this protocol will always succeed at member lookup (`x.foo` will
always be accepted by the compiler): members that are explictly declared in the type or in
a visible extension will be found and referenced, and anything else will be handled by the
dynamic lookup feature.

That behavior could lead to a surprising behavior change if the API evolves over time: adding
a new staticly declared member to the type or an extension will cause clients to resolve that
name to the static declaration instead of being dynamically dispatched.  This is inherent to
this sort of feature, and means it should not be used on types that have a large amount of
API, API that is likely to change over time, or API with names that are likely to conflict.

## Alternatives considered

A few alternatives were considered:

### Naming

Suggestions for a better name for the protocol and the subscript (along with rationale to
support them) are more than welcome.

On naming of `subscript(dynamicMember:)`, we intentionally gave it a long and verbose
names so they stay out of the way of user code completion.  The members of this protocol
are really just compiler interoperability glue.  If there was a Swift attribute to disable the
subscript from showing up in code completion, we would use it (such an attribute would
also be useful for the `LiteralConvertible` and other compiler magic protocols).

### Declare an explicit subscript requirement

We considered (and tried very hard) to declare an explicit `subscript` requirement inside the
protocol, but ran into several problems:

First, we seek to support both get-only and get/set dynamic
properties.  If we tried to reflect these capabilities into the type system, we'd end up
with two protocols: `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol` and
`MutableDynamicMemberLookupProtocol`.  This expands the surface area of the proposal,
and would make the implementation more complicated.

Second, recall that getters and setters can be both mutating and nonmutating.  We definitely
need the ability to represent that, but could choose to either reflect that in the requirement
signature (dramatically expanding the number of protocols) or not (make the requirement be
mutating for both, but allow an implementation to have a stricter implementation).  Both
options could work, but neither is great.

Third, the natural way to express the subscript requirement is with associated types, perhaps
something like this (using the simplest get-only case to illustrate the point):

```swift
protocol DynamicMemberLookupProtocol {
  associatedtype DynamicMemberLookupKeyword : ExpressibleByStringLiteral
  associatedtype DynamicMemberLookupValue
  subscript(dynamicMember name: DynamicMemberLookupKeyword)
    -> DynamicMemberLookupValue { mutating get }
}
```

However, if we go this approach, then this marker protocol is now a "Protocol with
Associated Type" (PAT) which (among other things) prevents protocols that further refine the
protocol from being usable as existentials - Swift does not yet support [Generalized
Existentials](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#generalized-existentials),
and probably will not until Swift 6 at the earliest.  This also pollutes the type with the two
associated type names.

The other attempted way to implement this was with a generic subscript, like this:

```swift
protocol DynamicMemberLookupProtocol {
  subscript<DynamicMemberLookupKeywordType: ExpressibleByStringLiteral,
            DynamicMemberLookupValue>
    (dynamicMember name: DynamicMemberLookupKeywordType)
        -> DynamicMemberLookupValue { mutating get }
}
```

This fixes the problem with PATs, but has the distinct disadvantage that it is impossible to
fulfill the subscript requirement with a concrete (non-generic) subscript implementation.

### Model this with methods, instead of a labeled subscript

It may be surprising to some that this functionality is modeled as a subscript instead of a
get/set method pair.  This is intentional though: subscripts are the way that Swift supports
parameterized l-values like we're are trying to expose here.  Exposing this as two methods
doesn't fit into the language as cleanly, and would make the compiler implementation more
invasive and crazy.

### Make this be a attribute on a type, instead of a protocol conformance

One option that came up in discussion was to model this as an attribute instead of a protocol
conformance.  Instead of:

```swift
struct PyVal : DynamicMemberLookupProtocol { ... }
```

we could spell this as something like:

```swift
@dynamicMemberLookup
struct PyVal { ... }
```

Both of these approaches can work.  The primary arguments in favor of the attribute is that
the `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol` is an unusual one in some ways:

1) It has no formal members.
2) The requirements are enforced by the compiler, not by the type system.
3) The requirements permit and use arbitrary overloads.
4) The protocol cannot (usefully) be used in a generic context or as a type constraint.
5) This protocol can only be conformed to in the main declaration, not in an extension.

All of those points are true, but the author of this proposal still thinks that this is better
modeled as a protocol, here are some reasons:

1) Protocols describe *semantics* of a conforming type, and this proposal provides key
    behavior to the type that conforms to it.
2) When a type uses this proposal, it provides a fundamental change to the type's behavior.
   While it isn't perfectly followed, attributes generally do not have this sort of effect on a type.
3) This is proposal allows a type to hook into primitive language syntax.  All of the ways to do
    this today are spelled with protocols (e.g. the `ExpressibleBy...` protocols.
4) Attributes are syntactically very light-weight, which makes this easier to overlook.
5) The oddities observed above may be eliminated over time if there is a reason to: for
    example, there is no technical reasons that types cannot retroactively conform.  It is
    theoretically possible that the Swift generics system could be extended to support these
    requirements, etc.
6) As Xiaodi Wu suggests, you could imagine this feature as one where conformance to the
    protocol gives a default implementation of an infinite number of methods.



### Reducing Potential Abuse

In the discussion cycle, there was significant concern about abuse of this feature, particularly
if someone retroactively conforms a type to `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol`.  For
this reason, the compiler only permits conformance of this protocol on the original type
definition, not extensions.

On the other hand, the potential for abuse has never been a strong guiding principle for Swift
features (and many existing features could theoretically be abused (including operator
overloading, emoji identifiers,
`AnyObject` lookup, `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional`, and many more).  If we look to
other language communities, we find that directly
analogous "dynamic" features were [added to C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/dynamic-language-runtime-overview) late in its evolution, and no one has produced evidence
that they led to abuse.

Furthermore, despite extensive discussion on the mailing list and lots of fear and uncertainty
about how this feature could be abused, no one has been able to produce (even one)
non-malicious example where someone would adopt this protocol inappropriately and lead to
harm for users (and of course, if you're consuming an API produced by a malicious entity, you
are already doomed. `:-)`).

Fortunately (if and only if a compelling example of harm were demonstrated) there are many
different ways to assuage concerns of "abuse" of this feature, e.g.:

1) We could prevent this from being a part of some other protocol definition, because any
    types that conform to that protocol will transitively get the conformance.  The cost of this is
    that it prevents use of dynamic member lookup with existentials (which are one of the core
    dynamic features of Swift), but we could relax that requirement in the future if there was a
    compelling use-case for doing so.

2) Have the compiler specifically bless individual well-known types, e.g. `Python.PyVal` (or
    whatever it is eventually named) by baking in awareness of these types into the compiler.
    Such an approach would require a Swift evolution proposal to add a new type that
    conforms to this.

3) We could add an attribute or use some other way to make conformance to
    `DynamicMemberLookupProtocol` more visible, e.g.:

```swift
@dynamic
struct PyVal : DynamicCallable {...}
```

If you are concerned about abuse, feel free to "+1" one of these alternatives in the review
cycle.  Ideas and other suggestions for how to reduce possibility of misuse are welcome as
well.


### Increasing Visibility of Dynamic Member Lookups

People have suggested that we add some explicit syntax to accesses to make the dynamic
lookup visible, e.g.: `foo.^bar` or presumably some punctuation character we haven't
already used.  In my opinion, this is the wrong thing to do for several reasons:

1) Swift's type system already includes features (optionals, IUOs, runtime failure) for handling
    failability.  Keeping that orthogonal to this proposal is good because that allows API
    authors to make the right decision for expressing the needs of their use-case.
2) Swift already has a dynamic member lookup feature, "`AnyObject` dispatch" which does
    not use additional punctuation, so this would break precedent.  The syntax and behavior
    of AnyObject dispatch was carefully considered in a situation that was directly analogous
    to this - Swift 1 days.
3) Adding punctuation to the lookup itself reduces the likelihood that an API author would
    make the lookups return strong optionals, because of syntactic noise.
4) The point of this proposal is to make use of dynamic language APIs more elegant than
    what is already possible: making use of them ugly (this punctuation character would be
    pervasive through use of the APIs and just add visual noise, not clarity) undermines the
    entire purpose of this proposal.
5) There are already other features (including operator overloading, subscripts, forthcoming
    `DynamicCallable`, etc) that are just as dynamic as property lookup when implemented
    on a type like `PyVal`.
6) Language syntax is not the only way to handle this.  IDEs like Xcode could color code
    dynamic member lookups differently, making their semantics visible without adversely
    affecting the code that is written.

It probably helps to consider an example.  Assume we used the `^` sigil to represent a dynamic
operation (member lookup, call, dynamic operator, etc).  This would give us syntax like
`foo.^bar` for member lookup, `baz^(42)` for calls.  The API author isn't forced to pick an
operator that follows this scheme, but has the option to do so.  Such a design would
change reasonable code like this:

```swift
  let np = Python.import("numpy")
  let x = np.array([6, 7, 8])
  let y =  np.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)

  let a = np.ones(3, dtype: np.int32)
  let b = np.linspace(0, pi, 3)
  let c = a+b
  let d = np.exp(c)
  print(d)
```

into:

```swift
  let np = Python.import("numpy")
  let b = np^.array^([6, 7, 8])
  let y =  np^.arange^(24)^.reshape^(2, 3, 4)

  let a = np^.ones^(3, dtype: np^.int32)
  let b = np^.linspace^(0, pi, 3)
  let c = a+^b
  let d = np^.exp^(c)
```

This does not improve clarity of code, it merely serves to obfuscate logic.  It is immediately
apparent from the APIs being used, the API style, and the static types (in Xcode or through
static declarations) that this is all Python stuff.  When you start mixing in use of native Swift
types like dictionaries (something we want to encourage because they are typed!) you end up
with an inconsistent mismash where people would just try adding syntax or applying fixits
continuously until the code builds.

The example gets ever worse if the implementation chooses to return a strong optional value,
because you'd end up with something like this (just showing a couple lines):

```swift
  let y = np^.arange?^(24)?^.reshape?^(2, 3, 4)!
  let a = np^.ones?^(3, dtype: np^.int32!)!
```

This is so bad that no one would actually do this.  Making the Python operators return
optionals would be even worse, since binary operators break optional chaining.

## Alternative Python Interoperability Approaches

In addition to the alternatives above (which provide different approaches to refine a
proposal along the lines of this one), there have also been a couple of different suggestions
for how to approach the problem of dynamic language interoperability in the whole.  Before
we explore those alternatives, we need to understand the common sources of concern.

The biggest objection to this proposal is that it is "completely dynamic", and some
people have claimed that Swift intentionally pushes people towards static types.  Others
claim that dynamic features like this are unsafe (what if a member doesn't exist?), and claim
that Swift does not provide unsafe features.

While the aims are largely correct for pure Swift code, the only example of langauge
interoperability we have so far is with C and Objective-C, and that interop is  memory
unsafe, unsound, and far more invasive than what we propose.  Observe:

1) Swift does have completely dynamic features, even ones that can be used unsafely or
    unwisely.  There was a recent talk at Swift Summit 2017 that explored some of these.
2) Bridging to dynamic languages inherently requires "fully dynamic" facilities, because the
    imported language has fully dynamic capabilities, and programmers use them.  This is
    pervasive in Python code, and is also reasonable common in Objective-C "the `id` type".
3) The Objective-C interoperability approach to handling the "inherently dynamic" parts of
   Objective-C is a feature called "AnyObject dispatch".  If you aren't failiar, it returns
   members lookup as `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional` types (aka, `T!` types), which are
   extremely dangerous to work with (though not "unsafe" in the Swift sense).
4) Beyond the problems with IUOs, Anyobject lookup is *also* completely non-type safe when
   the lookup is successful: it is entirely possible to access a property or method as "String"
   even if it were declared as an integer in Objective-C: the bridging logic doesn't even return
   such a lookup as `nil` in general.
5) The implementation of "AnyObject lookup" is incredibly invasive across the compiler and
    has been the source of a large number of bugs.
6) Beyond AnyObject lookup, the Clang importer itself is ~25 thousand lines of code, and
    while it is the source of great power, it is also a continuous source of bugs and problems.
    Beyond the code in the Clang importer library itself, it also has tendrils in almost
    every part of the compiler and runtime.

in contrast, the combination of the `DynamicMemberLookup` and `DynamicCallable`
proposals are both minimally invasive in the compiler, and fully type safe.  Implementations of
these proposals may choose to provide one of three styles of fully type safe implementation:

1) Return optional types, forcing clients to deal with dynamic failures.  We show an example
    of this in the JSON example above.
2) Return IUO types, providing the ability for clients to deal with dynamic failures, but allow
    them to ignore them otherwise.  This approach is similar to AnyObject dispatch, but
    actually type safe.
3) Return non-optional types, and enforce type safety at runtime with traps.  This is the
    approach followed in the Python interop example above, but that bridge is under
    development and may switch to another approach if it provides a better experience. The
    actual prototype already has a more holistic approach for handling failability that isn't
    describe here.

The style of design depends on the exact briding problem being solved, e.g. the customs of
the language being interoperated with.  Also, yes, it is possible to use these APIs to provide
an unsafe API, but that is true of literally every feature in Swift because provides support
for unsafe features as part of its goals to be pragmatic.

With this as background, let's explore the proposed alternatives approaches to dynamic
language interoperability.

### Direct language support for Python (and all the other languages)

We considered implementing something analogous to the Clang importer for Python, which
would add a first class Python specific type(s) to Swift language and/or standard library.  We
rejected this option because:

1) Such integration would **require that we do something like this proposal anyway**,
    because Python (like Objective-C) is a fundamentally dynamic language, and we need a
    way to express that fundamental dynamism: either this proposal or something like
    "`AnyObject` for Python".  I haven't heard a better proposal to solve this need.
2) Python is actually far less "inherently typed" than Objective-C is, because everything
    is typed with the equivalent of `id`, whereas the Objective-C community has used concrete
    types for many things (and with the introduction of Objective-C Generics and other
    features, this has become even more common).
3) it would be *significantly* more invasive in the compiler than this proposal.  While it is
    unlikely to be as large a scope of impact as the Clang importer in terms of bulk of code, it
    would require just as many tendrils spread throughout the compiler.
4)  Taking this approach would set the precedent for all other dynamic languages to get first
     class language support baked into the Swift compiler, leading to an even greater
     complexity spiral down the road.
5) The proposed "first class support" doesn't substantially improve the experience of working
    with Python over this proposal, so it is all pain and no gain.

Several people have suggested that a "Clang-importer" style Python interoperability approach
could use the "Type Hints" introduced in
[PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), which would invalidate that last
point above.  This approach to progressive typing for Python was prototyped in
[mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) and first [shipped in Python
3.5](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) in September 2015.

Unfortunately, it isn't reasonable to expect Type Hints to significantly improve the experience
working with Python in Swift for several reasons, including:

1) PEP 484 states: "It should also be emphasized that **Python will remain a dynamically
    typed language, and the authors have no desire to ever make type hints mandatory,
     even by convention.**" (the emphasis is by the authors of PEP 484).  This means we
     need this proposal or something like AnyObject lookup ... forever.
2) These annotations are only currently supported on a [provisional
    basis](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-provisional-api), which means that
    they are "deliberately excluded from .. backwards compatibility guarantees... up to and
    including removal of the interface".  Because they are subject to change and potentially
    removal, they haven't gotten wide adoption.
3) Unlike Objective-C type annotations, these type hints are inherently unsound by design.
    Further, Python APIs often creep to accepting many more types than a Swift programmer
    would expect, which means that a type annotation is often "so broad as to be unhelpful" or
    "too narrow to be correct".
4) These annotations are not dynamically enforced, and they are specifically designed to
    "influence" static analysis tools, which means that they are also frequently wrong.  In the
    context of a narrowly used static analysis tool, they are merely annoying.  In the context
    of bridging into Swift, being incorrect is a real problem.
5) The fact that they have only been available in Python **3** (which has a smaller community
    than Python 2) and have only been shipping for 2 years, means that they haven't been used
    by many people, and which contributes to their low adoption.
6) It is a goal to work with other dynamic language communities beyond Python, and not
    all have progressive typing facilities like this one.
7) Type annotations help the most in situations when you are "mixing and matching" Swift
    code with an existing body of some other code that you are able to modify.  While it is
    possible that some people will want to mix and match Swift and Python, by far the most
    common reason for wanting to interoperate with a dynamic langauge is to leverage the
    existing APIs that the community provides that you don't want to touch.  It isn't to
    progressively rewrite an app.
8) Finally, the idea of Swift providing a "better Python than Python itself does"
    under-appreciates the effort that the Python community has spent trying to achieve the
    same goals.  Its community includes a lot of people in it that understand the
    benefits of static and progressive typing (e.g. the [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) community)
    and they have spent a lot of time on this problem.  Despite their efforts, the ideas have low
    adoption: Swift bridging doesn't change the fundamental reasons for this.

Finally, it is important to realize that Swift and Clang have a
special relationship because they were designed by many of the same people - so their
implementations are similar in many respects.  Further, the design of both Clang and the
Objective-C language shifted in major ways to support interoperability with Swift - including
the introduction of ARC, Modules, Objective-C generics, pervasive lazy decl resolution, and
many more minor features) .

It is extremely unlikely that another established language/compiler community would accept
the scope of changes necessary to provide great importer support for them, and it is also
extremely unlikely that one would just magically work out of the box for what we need it to
do.  That said, our goals aren't to provide a better Python than Python, only to embrace
Python (and other dynamic languages) for what they are, without polluting the Swift compiler
and runtime with a ton of complexity that we'll have to carry around forever.


### Introduce F# style "Type Providers" into Swift

[Type providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tutorials/type-providers/) are
a cool feature of the F# language.  They are an expansive (and quite
complex) metaprogramming system which permits a "metaprogrammed library" to synthesize
types and other language features into the program based on statically knowable type
databases.  This leads to significantly improved type safety in the case where schemas for
dynamic APIs are available (e.g. a JSON schema) but which are not apparent in the source
code.

While type providers are extremely interesting and might be considered for inclusion into a
future macro system in Swift, it is important to understand that they just provide a way for
library developers to extend the compiler along the lines of the Clang importer in Swift.  As
such, they aren't actually helpful for this proposal for all of the reasons described
in the section above, but the most important point is that:

Type providers can only "provide" a type that is expressible in the language, and dynamic
 languages do have completely dynamic features, so **something that provides the
semantics of `DynamicMemberLookup` will be required** with that approach anyway.  We'd
have to take this proposal (or something substantially similar) before type providers would be
useful for Python in the first place.

Because of this, we believe that type providers and other optional typing facilities are
a potentially interesting follow-on to this proposal which should be measured according to
their own merits.  The author of this proposal is also personally skeptical that type providers
could ever be done in a way that is acceptable within the goals of Swift (e.g. to
someday have fast compile times).
