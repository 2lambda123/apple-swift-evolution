## Introduction

This proposal addresses significant unexpected performance gaps when using dictionaries. It introduces type-specific collections for a `Dictionary` instance's `keys` and `values` properties.

New `DictionaryKeys` and `DictionaryValues` collections provide efficient key lookup and mutable access to dictionary values, allowing in-place updates and copy-on-write optimization of stored values.

Swift-evolution thread: [[Proposal Draft] Provide Custom Collections for Dictionary Keys and Values](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161010/027815.html)


## Motivation

This proposal address two problems:

* While a dictionary's `keys` collection is fine for iteration, its implementation is inefficient when looking up a specific key, because `LazyMapCollection` doesn't know how to forward lookups to the underlying dictionary storage.
* Dictionaries do not offer value-mutating APIs. The mutating key-based subscript wraps values in an `Optional`. This prevents types with copy-on-write optimizations from recognizing they are singly referenced.

This proposal uses the following `[String: [Int]]` dictionary to demonstrate these problems:

```swift
var dict = ["one": [1], "two": [2, 2], "three": [3, 3, 3]]
```

### Inefficient `dict.keys` Search

Swift coders normally test key membership using `nil` checks or underscored optional bindings:

```swift
if dict["one"] != nil {
    // ...
}
if let _ = dict["one"] {
    // ...
}
```

These approaches provide the expected performance of a dictionary lookup but they read neither well nor "Swifty". Checking the `keys` view reads much better but introduces a serious performance penalty: this approach requires a linear search through a dictionary's keys to find a match.

```swift
if dict.keys.contains("one") {
    // ...
}
```

A similar dynamic plays out when comparing `dict.index(forKey:)` and `dict.keys.index(of:)`.

### Inefficient Value Mutation

Dictionary values can be modified through the keyed subscript by direct reassignment or by using optional chaining. Both of these statements append `1` to the array stored by the key `"one"`:

```swift
// Direct re-assignment
dict["one"] = (dict["one"] ?? []) + [1]

// Optional chaining
dict["one"]?.append(1)
```

Both approaches present problems. The first is complex and hard to read. The second ignores the case where `"one"` is not a key in the dictionary, and is therefore less useful even if more streamlined. Furthermore, neither approach allows the array to grow in placeâ€”they introduce an unnecessary copy of the array's contents even though `dict` is the sole holder of its storage.

Adding mutation to a dictionary's index-based subscripting isn't possible. Changing a key stored at a particular index would almost certainly modify its hash value, rendering the index incorrect. This violates the requirements of the `MutableCollection` protocol.

## Proposed Solution

This proposal adds custom collections for the `keys` and `values` dictionary properties. This follows the example set by `String`, which presents multiple views of its contents. A new `DictionaryKeys` collection introduces efficient key lookup, while a new `DictionaryValues` collection provides a mutable collection interface to dictionary values.

These changes make the simple approach for testing whether a dictionary contains a key an efficient one:

```swift
// Fast, not slow
if dict.keys.contains("one") {
    // ...
}
```

As a mutable collection, `values` enables modification without copies or clumsy code:

```swift
if let i = dict.index(forKey: "one") {
    dict.values[i].append(1)  // no copy here
} else {
    dict["one"] = [1]
}
```

Both the `keys` and `values` collections share the same index type as `Dictionary`. This allows the above sample to be rewritten as:

```swift
// Using `dict.keys.index(of:)`
if let i = dict.keys.index(of: "one") {
    dict.values[i].append(1)
} else {
    dict["one"] = [1]
}
```

## Detailed design

* The standard library introduces two new collection types: `DictionaryKeys` and `DictionaryValues`.
* A `Dictionary`'s `keys` and `values` properties change from `LazyMapCollection` to these new types. 
* The new collection types are not directly constructable. They are presented only as views into a dictionary.

```swift
struct Dictionary<Key: Hashable, Value>: ... {
    var keys: DictionaryKeys<Key, Value> { get }
    var values: DictionaryValues<Key, Value> { get set }
    
    // Remaining declarations
}

/// A collection view of a dictionary's keys.
struct DictionaryKeys<Key: Hashable, Value>: Collection {
    typealias Index = DictionaryIndex<Key, Value>
    subscript(i: Index) -> Key { get }

    // Other `Collection` requirements
}

/// A mutable collection view of a dictionary's values.
struct DictionaryValues<Key: Hashable, Value>: MutableCollection {
    typealias Index = DictionaryIndex<Key, Value>
    subscript(i: Index) -> Value { get set }

    // Other `Collection` requirements
}
```

A sample implementation of this proposal can be found in [this branch](https://github.com/apple/swift/compare/master...natecook1000:nc-dictionary).


## Impact on existing code

The performance improvements of using the new `DictionaryKeys` type and the mutability of the `DictionaryValues` collection are both additive in nature.

Most uses of these properties are transitory in nature. Adopting this proposal should not produce a major impact on existing code. The only impact on existing code exists where a program explicitly specifies the type of a dictionary's `keys` or `values` property. In those cases, the fix would be to change the specified type.


## Alternatives considered


1. The [Generics Manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md) lists nested generics as a goal. This could impact the naming and structure of these new collection types. 

   Instead of `DictionaryKeys<Key, Value>` and `DictionaryValues<Key, Value>`, these types could be `Dictionary<Key, Value>.Keys` and `Dictionary<Key, Value>.Values`. However, because many types in the standard library may be revisited once such a feature is available (indices, iterators, etc.), the current lack of nesting shouldn't prevent consideration of this proposal.

2. Add additional compiler features that manage mutation through existing key-based subscripting without the copy-on-write problems of the current implementation. This could potentially be handled by upcoming changes to copy-on-write semantics and/or inout access. 

3. Provide new APIs for updating dictionary values with a default value, eliminating the double-lookup for a missing key. The approach outlined in this proposal provides a way to remove one kind of double-lookup (mutating a value that exists) but doesn't eliminate all of them (in particular, checking for the existence of a key before adding).

   These could be written in a variety of ways:
    
    ```swift
    // Using a 'SearchState' type to remember key position
    dict.entries["one"]
        .withDefault([])
        .append(1)
    
    // Using a two-argument subscript
    dict["one", withDefault: []].append(1)
    
    // Using a closure with an inout argument
    dict.withValue(forKey: "one") { (v: inout Value?) in
        if v != nil {
            v!.append(1)
        } else {
            v = [1]
        }
    }
    ```

4. Restructure `Dictionary`'s collection interface such that the `Element` type of a dictionary is its `Value` type instead of a `(Key, Value)` tuple. That would allow the `Dictionary` type itself to be a mutable collection with an `entries` or `keysAndValues` view similar to the current collection interface. This interface might look a bit like this:

    ```swift
    let valuesOnly = Array(dict)
    // [[2, 2], [1], [3, 3, 3]]
    let keysAndValues = Array(dict.entries)
    // [("two", [2, 2]), ("one", [1]), ("three", [3, 3, 3])]
    
    let foo = dict["one"]
    // Optional([1])
    
    let i = dict.keys.index(of: "one")!
    dict[i].append(1)
    ```
