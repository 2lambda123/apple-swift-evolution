## Introduction

Swift‚Äôs `String` type is designed for Unicode correctness and abstracts away the underlying binary representation of the string to model it as a `Collection` of grapheme clusters. This is an appropriate string model for human-readable text, as to a human reader, the atomic unit of a string is (usually) the extended grapheme cluster. When treated this way, many logical string operations ‚Äújust work‚Äù the way users expect. 

However, it is also common in programming to need to express values which are intrinsically numeric, but have textual meaning, when taken as an ASCII value. We propose adding a new literal syntax takes single-quotes (`'`), and is transparently convertible to Swift‚Äôs integer types. This syntax, but not the behavior, will extend to all ‚Äúscalar‚Äù text literals, up to and including `Character`, and will become the preferred literal syntax these types.

## Motivation 

A major pain point of using ASCII and unicode integer codepoint values in Swift is they lack a clear and readable literal type. In C, `'a'` is a `uint8_t` literal, equivalent to `97`. Swift has no such equivalent, requiring awkward spellings like `UInt8(ascii: "a")`. Alternatives, like spelling out the values in hex or decimal directly, are even worse. This harms readability of code, and is one of the sore points of bytestring processing in Swift.

```c
static char const hexcodes[16] = {
    '0', '1', '2', '3', '4' ,'5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 
    'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'
};
```

```swift
let hexcodes = [
    UInt8(ascii: "0"), UInt8(ascii: "1"), UInt8(ascii: "2"), UInt8(ascii: "3"),
    UInt8(ascii: "4"), UInt8(ascii: "5"), UInt8(ascii: "6"), UInt8(ascii: "7"),
    UInt8(ascii: "8"), UInt8(ascii: "9"), UInt8(ascii: "a"), UInt8(ascii: "b"),
    UInt8(ascii: "c"), UInt8(ascii: "d"), UInt8(ascii: "e"), UInt8(ascii: "f")
]    
```

Sheer verbosity can be reduced by applying ‚Äúclever‚Äù higher-level constructs such as

```swift 
let hexcodes = [
    "0", "1", "2", "3",
    "4", "5", "6", "7",
    "8", "9", "a", "b",
    "c", "d", "e", "f"
].map{ UInt8(ascii: $0) }
```

or even 

```swift 
let hexcodes = Array(UInt8(ascii: "0") ... UInt8(ascii: "9")) + 
               Array(UInt8(ascii: "a") ... UInt8(ascii: "f"))
```

though this comes at the expense of an even higher noise-to-signal ratio, as we are forced to reference concepts such as function mapping, or concatenation, range construction, `Array` materialization, and run-time type conversion, when all we wanted to express was a fixed set of hardcoded values.

In addition, the `init(ascii:)` initializer only exists on `UInt8`. If you're working with other types like `Int8` (common when dealing with C APIs that take `char`), it is much more awkward.  Consider scanning through a `char*` buffer as an `UnsafeBufferPointer<Int8>`:

```swift
for scalar in int8buffer {
    switch scalar {
    case Int8(UInt8(ascii: "a")) ... Int8(UInt8(ascii: "f")):
        // lowercase hex letter
    case Int8(UInt8(ascii: "A")) ... Int8(UInt8(ascii: "F")):
        // uppercase hex letter
    case Int8(UInt8(ascii: "0")) ... Int8(UInt8(ascii: "9")):
        // hex digit
    default:
        // something else
    }
}
```

Aside from being ugly and verbose, transforming `Unicode.Scalar` literals also sacrifices compile-time guarantees. The statement `let char: UInt8 = 1989` is a compile time error, whereas `let char: UInt8 = .init(ascii: "ﬂÖ")` is a run time error.

ASCII scalars are inherently textual, so it should be possible to express them with a textual literal without requiring layers upon layers of transformations. Just as applying the `String` APIs runs counter to Swift‚Äôs stated design goals of safety and efficiency, forcing users to express basic data values in such a convoluted and unreadable way runs counter to our design goal of [expressiveness](https://swift.org/about/#swiftorg-and-open-source).

Integer character literals would provide benefits to `String` users. One of the [future directions](https://gist.github.com/milseman/bb39ef7f170641ae52c13600a512782f#unmanaged-strings) for `String` is to provide performance-sensitive or low-level users with direct access to code units. Having numeric character literals for use with this API is hugely motivating. Furthermore, improving Swift‚Äôs bytestring ergonomics is an [important part](https://forums.swift.org/t/prepitch-character-integer-literals/10442/140?u=taylorswift) of our long term goal of expanding into embedded platforms.

## Proposed solution 

Let's do the obvious thing here, and conform Swift‚Äôs integer types to `ExpressibleByUnicodeScalarLiteral`. These conversions will only be valid for the ASCII range `U+0 ..< U+128`; unicode scalar literals outside of that range will be invalid and treated similar to the way we currently diagnose overflowing integer literals. This is a conservative limitation which we believe is warranted, as allowing transparent unicode conversion to integer types carries major encoding pitfalls we want to protect users from.

| `ExpressibleBy`‚Ä¶ | `UnicodeScalarLiteral` | `ExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral` | `StringLiteral` | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `UInt8:`, ‚Ä¶ , `Int:` | yes* | no | no |
| `Unicode.Scalar:` | yes | no | no |
| `Character:` | yes (inherited) | yes | no |
| `String:` | no* | no* | yes |
| `StaticString:` | no* | no* | yes |

> Cells marked with an asterisk `*` indicate behavior that is different from the current language behavior.

As we are introducing a separate literal syntax `'a'` for ‚Äúscalar‚Äù text objects, and making it the preferred syntax for `Unicode.Scalar` and `Character`, it will no longer be possible to initialize `String`s or `StaticString`s from unicode scalar literals or character literals. To users, this will have no discernable impact, as double quoted literals will simply be inferred as string literals.

This proposal will have no impact on custom `ExpressibleBy` conformances, however, integer types `UInt8` through `Int` will now be available as source types provided by the `ExpressibleByUnicodeScalarLiteral.init(unicodeScalarLiteral:)` initializer. For these specializations, the initializer will be responsible for enforcing the compile-time ASCII range check on the unicode scalar literal. 

| `init(`‚Ä¶`)` | `unicodeScalarLiteral` | `extendedGraphemeClusterLiteral` | `stringLiteral` | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `:UInt8`, ‚Ä¶ , `:Int` | yes* | no  | no  |
| `:Unicode.Scalar`  | yes  | no  | no  |
| `:Character`       | yes (upcast) | yes | no  |
| `:String`          | yes (upcast) | yes (upcast) | yes (upcast) |
| `:StaticString`    | yes (upcast) | yes (upcast) | yes |

The ASCII range restriction will only apply to single-quote literals coerced to an integer type. Any valid `Unicode.Scalar` can be written as a single-quoted unicode scalar literal, and any valid `Character` can be written as a single-quoted character literal. 

|                    | `'a'` | `'√©'` | `'Œ≤'` | `'ìÄé'` | `'üë©‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è'` | `"ab"` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `:String`          |          |        |          |       |         | "ab"
| `:Character`       | `'a'`    | `'√©'`  | `'Œ≤'`    | `'ìÄé'` | `'üë©‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è'`
| `:Unicode.Scalar`  | U+0061   | U+00E9 | U+03B2   | U+1300E
| `:UInt32`          | 97       | 
| `:UInt16`          | 97       | 
| `:UInt8`           | 97       | 
| `:Int8`            | 97       |  

With these changes, the hex code example can be written much more naturally:

```swift
let hexcodes: [UInt8] = [
    '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 
    'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'
]

for scalar in int8buffer {
    switch scalar {
    case 'a' ... 'f':
        // lowercase hex letter
    case 'A' ... 'F':
        // uppercase hex letter
    case '0' ... '9':
        // hex digit
    default:
        // something else
    }
}
```

### Choice of single quotes

We propose to adopt the `'x'` syntax for all textual literal types up to and including `ExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral`, but not including `StringLiteral`. These literals will be used to express integer types, `Character`, `Unicode.Scalar`, and types like `UTF16.CodeUnit` in the standard library. 

The default inferred literal type for `let x = 'a'` will be `Character`, following the principle of least surprise. This also allows for a natural user-side syntax for differentiating methods overloaded on both `Character` and `String`.

Single-quoted literals will be inferred to be integer types in cases where a `Character` or `Unicode.Scalar` overload does not exist, but an unambiguous integer overload does. This is not the case with most integer operators, so expressions like `'1' + '1' == 98` would be an ambiguity error under Swift‚Äôs overload resolution rules.

Use of single quotes for character/scalar literals is *heavily* precedented in other languages, including C, Objective-C, C++, Java, and Rust, although different languages have slightly differing ideas about what a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù is.  We choose to use the single quote syntax specifically because it reinforces the notion that strings and character values are different: the former is a sequence, the later is a scalar (and "integer-like").  Character types also don't support string literal interpolation, which is another reason to move away from double quotes.

### Single quotes in Swift, a historical perspective

In Swift 1.0, we wanted to reserve single quotes for some yet-to-be determined syntactical purpose. However, today, pretty much all of the things that we once thought we might want to use single quotes for have already found homes in other parts of the Swift syntactical space.  For example, syntax for [multi-line string literals](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0168-multi-line-string-literals.md) uses triple quotes (`"""`), and string interpolation syntax uses standard double quote syntax. With the passage of [SE-0200](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0200-raw-string-escaping.md), raw-mode string literals settled into the `#""#` syntax. In current discussions around [regex literals](https://forums.swift.org/t/string-update/7398/6), most people seem to prefer slashes (`/`).

At this point, it is clear that the early syntactic conservatism was unwarranted.  We do not forsee another use for this syntax, and given the strong precedent in other languages for characters, it is natural to use it.

### Existing double quote initializers for characters

We propose deprecating the double quote literal form for `Character` and `Unicode.Scalar` types and slowly migrating them out of Swift.

```swift
let c2 = 'f'               // preferred
let c1: Character = "f"   // deprecated
```

## Detailed Design 

The only standard library changes will be to conform `{UInt8, Int8, ..., Int}` to `ExpressibleByUnicodeScalarLiteral`, and add them to the list of allowed `Self.UnicodeScalarLiteralType` types. (This entails conforming the integer types to `_ExpressibleByBuiltinUnicodeScalarLiteral` as well.) The ASCII range checking will be performed at compile-time in the typechecker, in essentially the same way that overflow checking for `ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral.IntegerLiteralType` types works today.

```swift
protocol ExpressibleByUnicodeScalarLiteral {
    associatedtype UnicodeScalarLiteralType: 
        {StaticString, ..., Unicode.Scalar} + {UInt8, Int8, ..., Int}
    
    init(unicodeScalarLiteral: UnicodeScalarLiteralType)
}
```

The default inferred type for all single-quoted literals will be `Character`, addressing a longstanding pain point in Swift, where `Character`s had no dedicated literal syntax.

```
typealias UnicodeScalarLiteralType           = Character
typealias ExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteralType = Character 
```

This will have no source-level impact, as all double-quoted literals get their default inferred type from the `StringLiteralType` typealias, which currently overshadows `ExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteralType` and `UnicodeScalarLiteralType`. The `UnicodeScalarLiteralType` typealias will remain meaningless, but `ExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteralType` typealias will now be used to infer a default type for single-quoted literals.

## Source compatibility 

This proposal could be done in a way that is strictly additive, but we feel it is best to deprecate the existing double quote initializers for characters, and the `UInt8.init(ascii:)` initializer.  

Here is a specific sketch of a deprecation policy: 
  
  * Continue accepting these in Swift 5 mode with no change.  
  
  * Introduce the new syntax support into Swift 5.1.
  
  * Swift 5.1 mode would start producing deprecation warnings (with a fixit to change double quotes to single quotes.)
  
  * The Swift 5 to 5.1 migrator would change the syntax (by virtue of applying the deprecation fixits.)
  
  * Swift 6 would not accept the old syntax.

During the transition period, `"a"` will remain a valid unicode scalar literal, so it will be possible to initialize integer types with double-quoted ASCII literals. 

```
let ascii:Int8 = "a" // produces a deprecation warning 
```

However, as this will only be possible in new code, and will produce a deprecation warning from the outset, this should not be a problem.

## Effect on ABI stability 

All changes except deprecating the `UInt8.init(ascii:)` initializer are either additive, or limited to the type checker, parser, or lexer. Removing `String` and `StaticString`‚Äôs `ExpressibleByUnicodeScalarLiteral` and `ExpressibleByExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral` conformances would otherwise be ABI-breaking, but this can be implemented entirely in the type checker, since source literals are a compile-time construct.

Removing `UInt8.init(ascii:)` would break ABI, but this is not necessary to implement the proposal, it‚Äôs merely housekeeping.

## Effect on API resilience 

None. 

## Alternatives considered 

### Integer initializers 

Some have proposed extending the `UInt8(ascii:)` initializer to other integer types (`Int8`, `UInt16`, ‚Ä¶ , `Int`). However, this forgoes compile-time validity checking, and entails a substantial increase in API surface area for questionable gain. 

### Lifting the ASCII range restriction 

Some have proposed allowing any unicode scalar literal whose codepoint index does not overflow the target integer type to be convertible to that integer type. Consensus was that this is an easy source of unicode encoding bugs, and provides little utility to the user. If people change their minds in the future, this restriction can always be lifted in a source and ABI compatible way.

### Single-quoted ASCII strings

Some have proposed allowing integer *array* types to be expressible by *multi-character* ASCII strings such as `'abcd'`. We consider this to be out of scope of this proposal, as well as unsupported by precedent in C and related languages.
