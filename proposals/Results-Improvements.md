# Feature name

* Proposal: [SE-NNNN](NNNN-Results-Improvements.md)
* Authors: [hfhbd](https://github.com/hfhbd), [Author 2](https://github.com/swiftdev)
* Review Manager: TBD
* Status: Implementation: [apple/swift#NNNNN](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27908)

## Introduction
In [SE-0235](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0235-add-result.md) the `Result` type was introduced.
This type should be improved by several functions and shortcuts.

Swift-evolution thread: [Discussion thread topic for that proposal](https://forums.swift.org/)

## Motivation

Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the
problem is that some common pattern is currently hard to express, show
how one can currently get a similar effect and describe its
drawbacks. If it's completely new functionality that cannot be
emulated, motivate why this new functionality would help Swift
developers create better Swift code.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe
how they work. Show how your solution is better than current
workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it involves new
syntax in the language, show the additions and changes to the Swift
grammar. If it's a new API, show the full API and its documentation
comments detailing what it does. The detail in this section should be
sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors to be able to
reasonably implement the feature.

## Source compatibility


## Effect on ABI stability

Does the proposal change the ABI of existing language features? The
ABI comprises all aspects of the code generation model and interaction
with the Swift runtime, including such things as calling conventions,
the layout of data types, and the behavior of dynamic features in the
language (reflection, dynamic dispatch, dynamic casting via `as?`,
etc.). Purely syntactic changes rarely change existing ABI. Additive
features may extend the ABI but, unless they extend some fundamental
runtime behavior (such as the aforementioned dynamic features), they
won't change the existing ABI.

Features that don't change the existing ABI are considered out of
scope for [Swift 4 stage 1](README.md). However, additive features
that would reshape the standard library in a way that changes its ABI,
such as [where clauses for associated
types](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0142-associated-types-constraints.md),
can be in scope. If this proposal could be used to improve the
standard library in ways that would affect its ABI, describe them
here.

## Effect on API resilience

API resilience describes the changes one can make to a public API
without breaking its ABI. Does this proposal introduce features that
would become part of a public API? If so, what kinds of changes can be
made without breaking ABI? Can this feature be added/removed without
breaking ABI? For more information about the resilience model, see the
[library evolution
document](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/LibraryEvolution.rst)
in the Swift repository.

## Alternatives considered

Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and
why you chose this approach instead.
