## Introduction

This proposal introduces flexible access control scoping to Swift. It offers an underlying additive architecture that mitigates Swift scoped access issues. For example, a Swift coder should not have to mark a symbol `internal` so it can be accessed in just one other file by a targeted consumer, delegate, or data source. The proposal retains Swift 3 keywords and expands scoping to match the level of customization found in other parts of the Swift programming language. 

This proposal follows on to [SE-0169](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0169-improve-interaction-between-private-declarations-and-extensions.md). SE-0169 proposed a minimal workaround to improve the less than ideal "access control situation we have today, while leaving open this direction for future discussion." 

## Background

Significant time and effort has been dedicated in the Swift Evolution community to refining Swift's scoped access model.

* [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md) introduced the current model. A year of deployment and real-world use has produced mixed reactions from the developer community. 

* [SE-0159](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0159-fix-private-access-levels.md) attempted to revert Swift's access control model back to the pre-SE-0025 Swift 2 design. It was rejected as too large a change, opposing Swift 4's source compatibility goals.

* [SE-0169](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0169-improve-interaction-between-private-declarations-and-extensions.md) focused on the narrow challenge of embracing Swift's extension-oriented design, allowing `private` access control to propagate to all uses of a type, regardless of whether those members are used within the original declaration or extensions. Under SE-0169:
	* Extensions within the same scope are granted access to a type's `private` members.
	* Extensions within the same scope are granted access to `private` members declared in other extensions of the same type.
	* John McCall writes, "The only question is whether extensions of the same type within a file should be considered part of the same scope for the purposes of 'private'."

## Motivation

SE-0169's adoption will not be sufficiently wide-reaching. It fails to address the following scenarios, which are covered by this proposal directly or as future directions: 

* Same-type access at the modular level above the current scope, generally referred to as `typeprivate`. 
* Access for derived types, both within the same scope and throughout the module.
* Unit test access. You should not need to mark a type `internal` or `public` solely to support unit test compatibility.
* Granting access to a limited set of client types within the same module, essentially creating a *submodule*, which is more restricted than `internal` access levels and less restricted than `private` access levels.

This last point is particularly important. Access levels should allow you to expose code to subsystems. For example, you might need to make a cache visible to multiple participants. For safety, that cache should not be exposed outside that subsystem. To accomplish this goal, you must select one of the following options:

1. Place everything in one file, leading to messy megafile implementations.
2. Mark the cache system as `internal` and break the safety contract.
3. Break the cache system into a separate framework, which might be difficult to justify architecturally, and which places a  higher load on compilation and execution.

Other examples include placing client, delegate, and data source code in separate files while limiting their visibility to the types they serve. 

As a final note, some inherently private protocol members must be marked `public` to enable public use by other protocol members. While these members shouldnâ€™t participate in published APIs, they have to due to Swift technical limitations. While we don't have a solution to this problem in this proposal, we hope that this proposal could be enhanced in the future to help solve this issue.

### Design Philosophy

Given the design realities of modifying access control in Swift 4, *success* depends on meeting the following criteria:

* **Source Compatible** The changes must be source compatible with Swift 3.
* **Addressing Harm** The changes must mitigate active harm within the language to fall within the scope of Swift 4.
* **Flexible** The changes must be sufficiently flexible to express a majority of the desired scenarios enumerated in the previous sections.
* **Extensible** The changes must be extensible, permitting new access levels to be introduced at a future date.
* **Documentable** The changes must support descriptions, encouraging integrated documentation markup and presentation for integration into the Xcode Quick Help system.
* **Readable** The changes must be readable and support code review. New terms may interchange with and be placed near existing keywords.
* **Low Impact** The changes must limit keyword impact and not clog the language.

## Proposed solution

We propose adding parameterized `accessgroup` declarations to establish access modifiers, both for existing Swift 3 keywords and user-driven requirements. Group modifiers express a symbol's *visible* and *override* scopes. System-supplied groups will provide source compatibility with Swift 3 (see the following sample). They can be extended using both custom group declarations and derived access groups modeled on existing groups:

```
// This is the default access level
accessgroup internal {
    visible: #module
    override: #module
}

// Private access 
accessgroup private {
    visible: #scope
    override: #scope
}

// Fileprivate access
accessgroup fileprivate {
    visible: #file
    override: #file
}

// Public access
accessgroup public {
    visible: #all
    override: #module
}

// Open access
accessgroup open: public {
    override: #all
}

// Final access denies subtyping and override
accessgroup final {
    override: #none
}
```

In some cases, developers may want to have a "one off" accessgroup declared inline on a type:

```swift
accessgroup { visible: #all, OtherType; override: #none } class SomeType {
    ...
}
```

## Detailed Design

Here is a near-approximation to the `accessgroup` grammar:

```
// An encompassing description of possible scope values
Scope :- 
    `#module`  |    // aka S3 `internal`, default
    `#all`     |    // aka S3 `public` or `open`
    `#none`    |    // hidden or denied
    `#scope`   |    // aka S3 `private`
    `#file`    |    // aka S3 `fileprivate`
    `#type`    |    // aka `typeprivate`
    `#subtype` |    // types *and* derived types
    TypeName        // specific type or protocol

// Scope references, which may include individual scopes
// and scopes derived from the parent access group
Scoping :- Scope | `super`

// Access group declaration, which may be optionally
// derived from a parent group
Group :- `accessgroup` (GroupName (: GroupName)? )? {   (AccessFeature)*, }

// Elements that may be assigned scopes
AccessFeature :- Visibility | Override

// Declaration visibility. Default is `#module` (aka `internal`)
Visibility :- `visible` : (Scoping, ...)

// Declaration overrides, either by subtyping or overriding a 
// method in a subtype, default is `#module` (aka `internal`)
Override :- `override` : (Scoping, ...)
```

This design was influenced by [SE-0077](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md). SE-0077 evolved Swift operator precedence syntax to introduce a more flexible and descriptive system. The Swift 3 precedence declaration describes operator qualities, incorporating meta-information about precedence levels, associativity, and assignment use. This `accessgroup` syntax reflects SE-0077's `precedencegroup` keyword and structured meta-information approach.

### Combining Modifiers

Under this proposal, Swift will continue to allow stacked access modifiers like this:

```swift
internal final class ClassName { ... }
```

Upon adoption, you'll be able to stack custom groups as well:

```swift
fileprivate customgroup class ClassName { ... }
```

The custom groups will support setter differentiation:

```swift
public private(set) myvar: T // ok
public customgroup(set) myvar: T // ok
```

#### Stacking Visibility

When stacked, visibility modifiers are additive. To introduce visibility to `CacheClass1` and `CacheClass2` client classes, create a `cacheprivate` access group:

```swift
accessgroup cacheprivate {
    visible: CacheClass1, CacheClass2
}

// stacked accessgroup visibility in declaration
private cacheprivate var importantString: String
```

Alternatively, incorporate private scope into the `cacheprivate ` declaration:

```swift
accessgroup cacheprivate: private {
    // derived visibility from private using `super` keyword
    visible: super, CacheClass1, CacheClass2
}

// Alternatively:
accessgroup cacheprivate {
    visible: #scope, CacheClass1, CacheClass2
}

// direct accessgroup visibility in declaration
cacheprivate var importantString: String
```

#### Stacking Overrides

When stacking overrides, the most restrictive override policy wins. In this example, `importantFunction` can be overridden throughout the file but not the module.

```swift
accessgroup fileoverride {
    override: #file
}

accessgroup moduleoverride {
    override: #module
}

fileoverride moduleoverride func importantFunction() {} 
```

Without this policy, adding `final` would be pointless. Anything stacking a less restrictive override would win.

#### Derived Values

An access group *derived* from another group is rubber-stamped with all those settings. Unless those values are incorporated as `super`, each additional `visible` or `override` declaration completely replaces its parent:

```swift
accessgroup groupAddingProtocol: groupWithoutProtocol {
    access: super, MyProtocol // additive
}

accessgroup groupAddingProtocol: groupWithoutProtocol {
    access: MyProtocol // replacement
}
```

### Diagnostics

The semantics around stacking and inheritance may make some combinations of access groups harder to immediately comprehend than the library-provided access groups. Diagnostics and editor support accommodate this issue by emitting warnings and marking confusing groups. Solutions include:

- Emitting warnings and supplying fix-its on `accessgroup` definitions when a group provides redundant information:
    
    ```swift
    accessgroup customAccess {
        visible: #type, #subtype // warning: Redundant "#type" is already included by "#subtype"
    }
    ```
    
    Warnings should also be emitted for redundancy introduced via inheritance:
    
    ```swift
    accessgroup submoduleAccess: internal {
        visible: super, AnotherType // warning: Redundant "AnotherType" is already included by super
    }
    ```
- Allowing users to option-click a marked `accessgroup` in Xcode to see its resolved visibility and overridability.
- Allowing users to option-click a marked type in Xcode to see its resolved visibility and overridability.

## Future Directions

The following topics should be considered as future directions for access groups.

### Availability

Availability, like visibility, is a meta description on a declaration. `accessgroups` could be extended to add an `available: ...` feature but that is beyond the scope of this proposal.

### Extensibility

It is conceivable that a type author may wish to indicate that a particular type *cannot* be extended. Currently, Swift has the model that all types are extensible. The `accessgroup` syntax provides an affordance for a hypothetical `extend: ...` feature whereby type authors can indicate who is allowed to extend their type.

### Unit Tests

A symbol should not adopt an unnecessarily broad access policy solely to support unit testing. While a separate `#test` scope should not be needed (as it can be fixed through other means), it should be considered as a short-term solution for adding a unit test scope in access groups. 

### Underscored Protocols

In Swift, developers cannot make a `public` type conform to a protocol to access its protocol extensions without making the protocol `public` as well. The core team should consider whether there needs to be a `#compilerpublic` scope that says either "expose this to the compiler for optimizations but donâ€™t show it to anyone else" or maybe "this is usable within the module, but has restricted exposure to the compiler outside of the module". That's just one example; there may be other solutions to this problem.

### Other Meta Attributes

By extending this concept further, `accessgroup` syntax could encompass more or all of the metadata around a type. In the case of methods, this could potentially mean folding in attributes like `@discardableResult` or an `@objc(...)` declaration.

## Source compatibility

This proposal preserves source compatibility.

## Effect on ABI stability

We are not aware of anything in this proposal that would affect ABI stability. There is nothing that changes calling conventions, memory layout, or dynamic features.

## Alternatives considered

[SE-0159](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0159-fix-private-access-levels.md) was rejected because of lack of source compatibility and the feeling of churn for a relatively minor feature.
