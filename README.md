# Swift Preview

## Introduction


### Included Submodules

_Modules will be listed here as they are approved._

- [SE_NNNN_PackageName: Package Title](https://github.com/apple/SE_NNNN_PackageName)

## Usage

To use the umbrella library in a Swift Package Manager project,
add the following to your `Package.swift` file's dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-preview.git", from: "0.0.0"),
```

> **Important:** The Swift Preview package is under continuous development, 
  and maintains a major version of `0` to indicate that it is not intended to be source stable.
  If you require source stability in your project, 
  add the individual submodules instead of the `swift-preview` package.

To be a truly great community, Swift needs to welcome developers from all walks of life, 
with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. 
A diverse and friendly community will have more great ideas, 
more unique perspectives, and produce more great code. 
We will work diligently to make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, 
Swift has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant. 
This document is used across many open source communities, 
and we think it articulates our values well.
