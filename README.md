**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed on the [swift-evolution forums](https://swift.org/community/#swift-evolution) first.

This repository tracks the ongoing evolution of Swift. It contains:

* Goals for upcoming Swift releases (this document).
* The [Swift evolution review status][proposal-status] tracking proposals to change Swift.
* The [Swift evolution process](process.md) that governs the evolution of Swift.
* [Commonly Rejected Changes](commonly_proposed.md), proposals that have been denied in the past.

This document describes goals for the Swift language on a per-release
basis. These releases include minor releases that add to the currently shipping
version plus one major release out.  Each release will have many
smaller features or changes independent of these larger goals, and not
all goals will be reached for each release.

For historical purposes, the bottom of the document includes goals for past versions. These goals do not necessarily indicate which
features actually shipped for a given version. Those are documented in each versionâ€™s release notes.
